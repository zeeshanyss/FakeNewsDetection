13544,"SANCTIMONIOUS, OPEN-BORDERS PAUL RYAN Is Tanking In Polls…Will FED UP Voters Avenge Non-Trump Supporters In November?","Will Republican voters take down sanctimonious RINO s like Speaker Ryan when they hit the voting booths for Trump in 2016? Paul Ryan s reluctance to get behind Trump and support his bid for President may actually hurt his chances of re-election in November. Ryan s arrogance and lack of interest in supporting the very popular Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump may cause him to lose a large number of voters who were previously behind him. A poll of likely Republican voters shows House Speaker Paul Ryan well below 50 percent in his race to maintain his seat in Wisconsin s first Congressional district. The poll was conducted by P.M.I., with 424 respondents randomly called from a file of 11,000 likely GOP primary voters. It shows that with one month remaining before Wisconsin s August 9th vote, Ryan is polling at 43 percent.Ryan s challenger, Wisconsin businessman Paul Nehlen, is polling at 32 percent.The Nehlen campaign notes that Ryan s 43 percent  represents a drop of more than 30 points since the Nehlen campaign began polling likely Republican primary voters earlier in the year. This poll shows voters are considering their options and choosing to opt out of Paul Ryan s job-killing policies,  Nehlen said.The new poll could be viewed as a warning sign to Ryan, as Wisconsin voters may be growing increasingly frustrated with the key elements of Ryan s longstanding policy agenda.Nehlen told Breitbart that the reason Ryan has tanked below 50 percent in the latest poll is a direct result of his policies on trade, immigration, and national sovereignty. Paul Ryan is the most open borders, pro-Wall Street, anti-worker member of Congress in either party,  Paul Nehlen said during a Saturday press conference, which was held in front of Ryan s border wall surrounding his Janesville mansion.  Everything that Americans despise about their government, Paul Ryan represents  Can you name one time when Paul Ryan fought as hard for you and your family as he s fought for corporate America?  Nehlen asked.In recent weeks, Nehlen has launched an aggressive billboard campaign that has thrown a spotlight on Ryan s longstanding support for open borders immigration policies that would flood the labor market, as well as trade policies that ship American jobs overseas.On immigration, Ryan has a two-decade long history of pushing open borders policies. Dating back to his time as a Congressional staffer in the mid-90s, Ryan worked to derail the bipartisan immigration curbs inspired by Civil Rights leader and late-Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.In 2013, Ryan worked hand in hand with Luis Gutierrez to push Marco Rubio s border-opening immigration agenda.For years, Ryan has been vocal about his desire to enact open borders. Every month the U.S. imports a population of immigrants that is larger than the occupancy of Lambeau Field. Yet Ryan has repeatedly pushed policies that would make that number even larger despite the fact that 92% of the GOP electorate, and 83% of the American electorate in general, want to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.Just last year, Ryan s omnibus spending bill funded a controversial expansion of the refugee resettlement program funding visas for nearly 300,000 (temporary and permanent) Muslim migrants within the course of a single year.Despite the fact that seven in ten GOP Wisconsin voters support Donald Trump s proposal to enact a temporary pause on Muslim migration, Ryan has ruled out curbing Muslim migration into the United States insisting  that s not who we are. Every year the U.S. issues visas to a population of temporary and permanent Muslim migrants that is larger in size than the number of Paul Ryan voters in Wisconsin s first Congressional district.On trade, Ryan has been one of Congress  leading advocates for globalist policies that have impacted American jobs.Since Ryan took office in 1999, Wisconsin has lost one-fifth of its total manufacturing jobs.Yet in 2015, Ryan acted as President Obama s  partner  in his effort to fast track the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). In a 2015 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Ryan described the TPP as a  historic  agreement, which  would mean greater access to a billion customers for American manufacturers, farmers, and ranchers. Wisconsin suffered a net loss of nearly 40,000 jobs in 2015 alone due to the U.S. trade deficit with TPP countries, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Wisconsin exit polls showed that a majority of Wisconsin GOP voters (54%) believe that foreign trade kills jobs.Moreover, in recent months, Ryan has taken a series of actions that seem designed to undermine his own party s 2016 presidential aspirations and further the candidacy Hillary Clinton.Ryan dragged out his decision to endorse Donald Trump for weeks leaving voters with the distinct impression that Ryan does not consider the choice between Trump versus Clinton to be an easy one.Although Ryan has now technically endorsed Trump, he continues to be one of Trump s most frequent public critics. In interviews about the election, Ryan seems much more aggressive in attacking Trump than he has been in going after Hillary Clinton.In this sense, some argue that Ryan has perhaps done more damage to Trump with his endorsement than he could have done by not endorsing him much the same way that Rick Santorum helped tank Marco Rubio by giving one of the worst endorsement interviews in history, in which he could not name a single accomplishment of Sen. Rubio.Nehlen s spokesman said that in light of the growing momentum in the district, the campaign is planning to substantially increase its expenditures. Nehlen s spokesman, Eric Odom, said:The Nehlen camp is running a full campaign operation with more than 1,000 doors being knocked each day, targeted mail dropping into homes, billboards up all over the district, aggressive sign marketing, TV and radio ads blanketing the district and mobile marketing reaching voters in ways that are making a significant impact. This effort is presenting profound influence in the district and voters are liking what they see. This poll, and the momentum that comes with it, has us ready to increase expenditures and step up our fight in a big way.For entire story: Breitbart",politics,"Jul 10, 2016",1
10447,Senator Shelby starts to break banking nominee logjam,"Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby on Tuesday started to ease the backlog of 16 Obama administration nominees stalled before the panel, scheduling a March 15 confirmation hearing for two Securities and Exchange Commission nominees. The move follows Shelby’s resounding Republican primary victory in Alabama a week ago for a sixth term in the Senate.  The committee will question Lisa Fairfax and Hester Peirce for the SEC positions at the hearing as well as Matthew Jeppson to be director of the U.S. Mint. But 13 other nominations remain, including for two Federal Reserve Board governors, the U.S. Treasury’s top anti-terrorist finance official and a U.S. Export-Import Bank board member. Without the EXIM board member approved, the trade bank cannot approve large loans or guarantees above $10 million, effectively locking it out of deals for Boeing Co commercial aircraft or major power equipment made by General Electric. Conservatives, including Shelby, had waged a major campaign to close the trade bank last year, idling it for more than five months before Congress voted to renew its charter. He told Reuters in December that the EXIM nomination would be a “lower priority for him.”   The Fed nominees, former community banker Allan Landon and University of Michigan economist Kathryn Dominguez, would restore the central bank’s board to its full capacity of seven members.  Many had written off their chances of being confirmed, in part because of the testy relationship between Congress and the Fed, which has opposed Republican bills it says would curb its independence.",politicsNews,"March 8, 2016 ",0
14621,Greeks in mourning and disbelief after flood that killed at least 15,"Greeks voiced despair and disbelief on Thursday after a flash flood killed at least 15 people and left hundreds homeless, with many blaming a system that allowed houses to be built on dried up river beds. In the towns of Nea Peramos and Mandra west of the capital Athens, crumpled cars and mangled furniture lay on roads coated in the thick mud left behind by a raging torrent that smashed through homes on Wednesday morning.  We are ruined. My tavern and my house are gone,  said Paraskevas Stamou, a restaurant owner in Mandra.  Everything is gone, the road is gone, the water is still flowing and we were flooded again last night and this morning.  We are expecting another downpour tonight. It s like God hates us,  he told Reuters. To escape the lethal floodwaters, residents took desperate measures.  We had nowhere to sleep. We slept on the roof, we found carpets to cover ourselves,  said a man in Mandra whose house was gutted by the flood but remained standing. Between sobs, his mother added:  Everything went. We don t have anyone to help us. I don t have help from anyone.     Elderly people wandered the streets in muddied clothing, looking bewildered.  What I am concerned about is the indifference - there was no one there by our side to say,  take courage . I didn t want anything else, nothing,  said Mandra resident Maria Kriada.  Did anyone ask me if I had any water to drink? If I had any food to eat? If I had somewhere to sleep? No one came to say this.  Bad weather continued on Thursday. Officials said they were waiting for conditions to improve before giving a clearer picture of the damage. Five people were still missing.  Flags flew at half-mast from state buildings and the Acropolis on Thursday as the government declared three days of national mourning. Newspapers expressed anger.  A Crime,  was the headline in Ta Nea daily, superimposed on a picture of a woman being comforted next to an overturned car.  The Deeds of Man,  wrote the leftist Avgi, referring to unlicensed constructions. Experts blamed haphazard construction which the natural path for water runoff obstructed, and soil erosion on a mountain range hit by fires. Both towns were built along an old motorway linking Athens to the Peloponnese city of Corinth. As building crept closer to the road, streams that would have drained runoff from the nearby Pateras mountains were blocked.  Of course the state wasn t prepared ... we cannot compete with nature,  said Christos Zeferos, head of the research center for Atmospheric Physics and Climatology Academy of Athens, adding that climate change meant people should expect more weather-related disasters.  We should be prepared for more frequent, and different phenomena,  he told Reuters. Many of the victims were elderly. The youngest was a 36-year old truck driver who called his mother as the floodwaters rose around his lorry. The line went dead soon afterwards.",worldnews,"November 16, 2017 ",1
5524,Philadelphia prosecutor will not seek reelection after ethics fine,"Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said on Friday he would not run for reelection this year, saying he made “regrettable mistakes” when he accepted gifts that resulted in the city ethics board ordering him to pay a record fine. Williams, a Democrat, had already been expected to face several challengers in the May primary election for the top law enforcement position in the fifth-most-populous U.S. city. Last month, Williams agreed to pay $62,000 in civil penalties to end an investigation by the Philadelphia ethics board into his failure to disclose gifts including NBA basketball tickets, cash and lodging. The ethics board said it was the largest amount in penalties it had imposed in its 10-year history.  The gifts prompted the FBI to interview members of the prosecutor’s staff and at least one of the gift-givers, and the bureau is investigating a nonprofit Williams founded, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday. Williams apologized at a televised news conference. “My decisions to accept gifts and fail to report them brought much embarrassment, shame and adverse publicity to me and, unfortunately, to the office which I love,” he said. “For this, I will always hold deep regret in my heart.” Another top Pennsylvania prosecutor, former state attorney general Kathleen Kane, resigned in August after she was convicted of leaking confidential grand jury information and then lying about it to investigators. Kane, a Democrat, was sentenced to 10 to 23 months in prison. Williams, first elected in 2009 and reelected in 2013, is the first black district attorney in the history of Pennsylvania.  His 600-person office handles 40,000 criminal cases a year, from minor crimes to murders. He said he was proud of changes he had made in the office, such as involving senior prosecutors in the earliest stages of cases.",politicsNews,"February 10, 2017 ",1

16718,"After question on foreign meddling in Brexit, UK says democracy secure","Britain s democracy is one of the most secure in the world and will remain so, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday in response to a question about a suggestion that there may have been foreign interference in the Brexit vote. Opposition lawmaker Ben Bradshaw last week urged the government to look into reports by advocacy group Open Democracy suggesting that the origin of some Brexit campaign funds was unclear. Bradshaw said in parliament the issue should be investigated  given the widespread concern over foreign and particularly Russian interference in Western democracies . At a briefing with reporters, May s spokesman was asked if the prime minister was concerned about the reports.  I am not aware of those concerns,  he said.  More broadly, as we ve always said, the UK democratic system is amongst one of the most secure in the world and will continue to be so.  Open Democracy, which describes itself as an independent media platform aiming to challenge power and encourage debate, had raised questions about the finances of businessman Arron Banks, one of the main financial backers of the Brexit cause.  The only people concerned are those that still can t come to terms with the fact that they lost the referendum so will come up with more and more ludicrous excuses,  Banks said in a statement texted to Reuters by a spokesman. Banks dismissed Open Democracy s report without addressing it in detail and accused Bradshaw of peddling a  tedious myth  about Russian meddling in the Brexit debate. The Electoral Commission, which regulates political finance in Britain, said in April it was investigating campaign spending by Leave.EU, one of the pro-Brexit organizations funded by Banks. It gave no details of what its probe was about.  I m not remotely worried. We did nothing wrong,  Banks said in the text. A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said the investigation was still going on and it would not provide any further information until it was complete. Open Democracy had also raised concerns about a large donation to Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is now propping up May s minority Conservative government. Open Democracy said the origin of the money, which was spent on campaigning for Brexit, was unclear.  The DUP, which was earlier reported to have said the funds came from  an organization in England that wants to see the union (between the UK s constituent parts) kept , did not respond to repeated requests for comment. During a debate in parliament later on Monday, May was asked whether EU leaders had discussed the issue of Russian interference at a summit last week.

20744,Florida residents heed Irma warnings after Harvey's destruction,"Hurricane Harvey s destruction in Texas may not have altered Florida s well-tested storm plans, but it appears to have infused residents with a new sense of urgency as they prepare for approaching Hurricane Irma. Officials said Harvey s devastating flooding, coupled with the sheer power of Irma, ranked as the strongest Atlantic storm on record, had sharpened the focus of Floridians who were somewhat indifferent about preparing for past hurricanes.  A lot of times they end up having hurricane parties here instead of evacuating,  Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said by phone.  That s been the opposite this time around.  Monroe County includes the Florida Keys, which ordered evacuations for all residents and tourists. Clark said she saw a steady stream of traffic leaving the travel destination as she drove to work early on Wednesday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasts that Irma may strike southern Florida on Saturday, when it could still be a major hurricane.  As it neared Puerto Rico on Wednesday with maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour (295 kph), Irma was a Category 5 storm, the highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity.  This storm is bigger, faster and stronger than Hurricane Andrew,  Florida Governor Rick Scott told a news conference on Wednesday, referring to one of the costliest storms in U.S. history that struck southern Miami-Dade County 25 years ago. For south Florida, Hurricane Irma  is a once-in-a-generation storm. It s the Big One for us,  Ed Rappaport, acting director of the hurricane center, told WFOR-TV in Miami on Wednesday evening.  Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez on Wednesday evening announced mandatory evacuations for most of the county s coastal cities beginning at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) on Thursday. Miami-Dade has a population of 2.7 million. The evacuation orders affect more than 100,000 residents, the Miami Herald reported. Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine had already urged residents of that city on Tuesday to evacuate.  We don t want any heroes,  he said.  We want people to bring themselves to a safer place than a barrier island.  Officials across Florida said they saw signs of people taking Irma more seriously than past storms.  Residents were stocking up on water and batteries and even complaining that county leaders were not being quick enough to announce evacuations, said Don Walker, spokesman for Brevard County Emergency Management. Houston officials were criticized for not ordering an evacuation ahead of the flooding that left hundreds of people in the country s fourth-largest city trapped in their homes.  Everyone is really in tune with this storm system. My neighbors are talking about it, and we don t usually do that,  Walker said. For years, many Florida residents, joined by an ever-growing number of newcomers, paid little heed to hurricane warnings as most opted to stay in their homes, county officials said. Not this time around.  I ll tell you for the community, heck yeah, they re taking this more seriously,  said Teri Barbera, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff s Office, noting that many stores were out of bottled water by Monday.

3978,U.S. Congress to give Puerto Rico short-term Medicaid help,"Ailing Puerto Rico would receive $295 million in Medicaid funding from the federal government as part of the U.S. Congress’ spending plan to avert a government shutdown, Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Monday.  Rossello said in a statement in Spanish that he was “grateful” for the addition in the spending bill reached late Sunday night.  The full House of Representatives and Senate must approve the bipartisan pact, though prompt passage was expected this week. Puerto Rico’s public health system is nearly insolvent, a key driver of emigration that has decimated the U.S. territory’s population as it wrestles with $70 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate and unemployment twice the U.S. average. The island faces a deadline at midnight Monday to negotiate a debt-cutting agreement with creditors, or open itself up to lawsuits over debt defaults. It could also file for a modified version of U.S. bankruptcy to protect itself from such litigation. One creditor, who owns insured Puerto Rican bonds, said the proposal was “not even close to a good proposal. “Not just lowball but also not a well constructed proposal,” said Sean Burgess, portfolio manager and lead trader for Puerto Rico strategy at Sarasota, Florida-based Cumberland Advisors. The island’s aggressive lobbying for federal healthcare funding in Washington is seen as a possible detractor to filing bankruptcy, which would not garner sympathy from Congressional Republicans who opposed the in-court restructuring provision in last year’s Puerto Rico rescue law, PROMESA. The $295 million will help fund the island’s Medicaid budget for fiscal year 2018, which starts July 1, and enable Puerto Rico to contract with managed care health insurance companies that administer the Medicaid program.  Without the money, the island would have to run the Medicaid program on its own, a massive undertaking that Puerto Rico is not equipped to do, said island Health Secretary Dr. Rafael Rodríguez-Mercado. But Puerto Rico will still need an additional $300 million to fund its entire Medicaid budget for fiscal year 2018, Rodríguez-Mercado told Reuters in an interview on Monday. He hopes that money will come from the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in September. Puerto Rico’s $2.76 billion Medicaid budget has been funded in part by a one-time pool of money provided to U.S. territories under the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare.  That money is expected to run out by the end of 2017, triggering what island officials call the “Medicaid cliff” — the return to a federal funding cap of $321 million for Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program. U.S. territories receive proportionately less federal Medicaid reimbursement than U.S. states. Prior to Obamacare, Puerto Rico partially funded its Medicaid budget through bonds, exacerbating the island’s debt crisis.  In recent weeks, Governor Ricardo Rossello has been lobbying to boost Puerto Rico’s healthcare funding, warning that Washington’s failure to do so would leave some 900,000 people without health coverage.",politicsNews,"May 1, 2017 ",1
12829,Zimbabwe judge frees ousted finance minister on bail,"A Zimbabwean judge freed ousted finance minister Ignatius Chombo on bail on Thursday in a ruling that underlined judicial independence just three weeks after the army helped depose Robert Mugabe. Chombo, a senior member of the  G40  faction of the ruling party that was targeted in the military s Nov. 15 intervention, was dragged from his home in the middle of the night and held incommunicado by soldiers at an undisclosed location for a week. During that time he was beaten, according to his lawyer. He was arrested by police on his release and charged with fraud and abuse of office relating to his time as a government minister over a decade ago. The Harare magistrate s court denied him bail. However, High Court judge Edith Mushore condemned that ruling as  littered with mis-directions  and  wading into the muddy court of public opinion  after the massive army-backed protests that helped topple Mugabe after 37 years in power. Chombo, 65, was ordered to be released on $5,000 bail, surrender his passport and the title deeds of his Harare mansion and report to a police station in the capital three times a day. The tone and substance of Mushore s ruling also sent a stern message to the army-backed administration of President Emmerson Mnangagwa about the independence of the courts and the primacy of the law, aspects of public life often ignored by Mugabe. During his detention by the military, Chombo had been denied basic rights enshrined in the constitution such as access to justice and presumption of innocence, Mushore said. In particular, she said Zimbabweans needed to know they  can sleep at night  without the fear of arbitrary detention in secret locations beyond the reach of lawyers or family - a common feature of the police state run by Mugabe.  The public in Zimbabwe needs to know that they have a right to access to justice,  she said. Chombo was one of several G40 figures detained during the military s  Operation Restore Legacy  that was officially launched to remove  criminals  around Mugabe. Most Zimbabweans interpreted this as meaning Mugabe s 52-year-old wife Grace, who was positioning herself as a successor to her 93-year-old husband at the expense of Mnangagwa, who was purged from the ruling party in early November. Chombo s lawyer says he will deny the charges when his trial starts. In a cursory analysis, Mushore characterized the state s case against him as  mere allegation .",worldnews,"December 7, 2017 ",1

6987,Just one Trump transition aide for U.S. spy agencies: officials,"Only one member of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team is dealing with the CIA and the 16 other offices and agencies that make up the U.S. intelligence community, four U.S. officials said Wednesday. Geoffrey Kahn, a former House intelligence committee staffer, is the only person named so far to Trump’s intelligence community “landing team,” they said.  As a result, said one senior career intelligence officer, briefing books prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency, the National Counterterrorism Center, and 13 other agencies and organizations are “waiting for someone to read them.””It seems like an odd time to put issues like cyber security and international terrorism on the back burner,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Previous administrations, the official said, were quicker to staff their intelligence teams, in part because they considered intelligence issues critical to setting foreign policy, defense and budget priorities. The intelligence community has some 200,000 employees and contractors and an annual budget of more than $70 billion. It collects and analyzes information on a vast array of subjects, from national security threats such as terrorism and climate change to global conflicts and the foreign, defense and trade policies of foreign governments.     Kahn has been in periodic contact with the CIA, said two of the officials, adding that they did not know if he had been in touch with the other intelligence agencies. In addition to reviewing potential candidates for top posts, Kahn is responsible for coordinating briefings for nominees and helping prepare them for Senate confirmation hearings. Trump has announced that he intends to nominate U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas to succeed CIA Director John Brennan, who will step down in January.  He has yet to tap nominees for other senior positions, including a successor to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, the top U.S. intelligence officer. Clapper, 75, will leave the government when Trump is sworn as president on January 20.  Trump on Tuesday received only his third intelligence briefing since he won the Nov. 8 presidential election, despite an offer from President Barack Obama of daily briefings, three of the officials said. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has been receiving intelligence briefings daily or nearly every day, one of the officials said. Trump’s decision to forgo daily briefings and his delay in designating more transition advisers to engage with the intelligence agencies may reflect his focus on filling the top economic positions in his administration. However, said the senior career official, it also may reflect the disinterest and distrust in U.S. intelligence Trump has expressed during and after his presidential campaign. Asked on Aug. 17 if he trusted U.S. intelligence, Trump replied: “Not so much from the people that have been doing it for our country. I mean, look what’s happened over the last 10 years.” After his first classified briefing as the Republican presidential candidate, Trump said he “didn’t learn anything” that prompted him to rethink his view about how to fight Islamic State. On the other hand, he said, “When they call it intelligence, it’s there for a reason.”On other occasions, he has contradicted or ignored what his briefers told him. After being briefed that U.S. intelligence had concluded that the Russian government was behind the hacking of U.S. political institutions, he said that “maybe there is no hacking” or than maybe it was China or “somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.”Trump’s attitude contrasts with those of his predecessors. In his book “Getting to Know the President,” veteran CIA officer John Helgerson wrote that former President Jimmy Carter asked for longer briefings and Bill Clinton asked the CIA to expand his daily briefs to include economic and environmental issues.",politicsNews,"November 30, 2016 ",1
18022,VIOLENT ANTIFA THUGS WEAR MASKS To Hide Their Identities…Let’s Make Sure Every American Sees Their Mug Shots,"Antifa is a violent, anti-fascist protest group with deep roots in the political left. The disparate, loosely organized factions of the group are peppered throughout the country and show up at events that they deem  fascist  in order to disrupt and often engage in criminal behavior.A detailed list of what antifa stands for is hard to pin down, but it is certainly anti-Trump, and the group s tactics typically involve the destruction of property and violence towards innocent civilians.That violence has resulted in a number of antifa arrests over the past few months.

2,Senior U.S. Republican senator: 'Let Mr. Mueller do his job',"The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said.",politicsNews,"December 31, 2017 ",1
7093,"Trump won with lowest minority vote in decades, fueling divisions","Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency with less support from black and Hispanic voters than any president in at least 40 years, a Reuters review of polling data shows, highlighting deep national divisions that have fueled incidents of racial and political confrontation. Trump was elected with 8 percent of the black vote, 28 percent of the Hispanic vote and 27 percent of the Asian-American vote, according to the Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll. Among black voters, his showing was comparable to the 9 percent captured by George W. Bush in 2000 and Ronald Reagan in 1984. But Bush and Reagan both did far better with Hispanic voters, capturing 35 percent and 34 percent, respectively, according to exit polling data compiled by the non-partisan Roper Center for Public Opinion Research.  And Trump’s performance among Asian-Americans was the worst of any winning presidential candidate since tracking of that demographic began in 1992. The racial polarization behind Trump’s victory has helped set the stage for tensions that have surfaced repeatedly since the election, in white supremacist victory celebrations, in anti-Trump protests and civil rights rallies, and in hundreds of racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic hate crimes documented by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks extremist movements. The SPLC reports there were 701 incidents of “hateful harassment and intimidation” between the day following the Nov. 8 election and Nov. 16, with a spike in such incidents in the immediate wake of the vote.     Signs point to an ongoing atmosphere of confrontation.     The Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a white separatist group that vilifies African-Americans, Jews and other minorities, plans an unusual Dec. 3 rally in North Carolina to celebrate Trump’s victory. Left-wing and anarchist groups have called for organized protests to disrupt the president-elect’s Jan. 20 inauguration. And a “Women’s March on Washington,” scheduled for the following day, is expected to draw hundreds of thousands to protest Trump’s presidency.     American politics became increasingly racialized through President Barack Obama’s two terms, “but there was an attempt across the board, across the parties, to keep those tensions under the surface,” says Jamila Michener, an assistant professor of government at Cornell University.  Trump’s anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric “brought those divisions to the fore; it activated people on the right, who felt empowered, and it activated people on the left, who saw it as a threat,” she added.     That dynamic was evident last week.     When Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended the Broadway musical “Hamilton” in New York on Friday, the multi-ethnic cast closed with a statement expressing fears of a Trump presidency. A far different view was on display the next day as a crowd of about 275 people cheered Trump’s election at a Washington conference of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist group with a strong anti-Semitic beliefs.      “We willed Donald Trump into office; we made this dream our reality,” NPI President Richard Spencer said. After outlining a vision of America as “a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity,” he closed with, “Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!” Though Trump’s election victory was driven by white voters, his performance even among that group was not as strong as some of his predecessors. Reagan and George H.W. Bush both won the presidency with higher shares of the white vote than the 55 percent that Trump achieved.      The historical voting patterns reflect decades of polarization in American politics, but the division surrounding Trump appears more profound, says Cas Mudde, an associate professor specializing in political extremism at the University of Georgia. These days, he adds, “people say they don’t want their children even to date someone from the other party.”     Indeed, voters’ opinions of those on the opposite side of the partisan divide have reached historic lows. Surveys by the Pew Research Center showed this year that majorities of both parties held “very unfavorable” views of the other party – a first since the center first measured such sentiment in 1992. And the lion’s share of those people believe the opposing party’s policies “are so misguided that they threaten the nation’s well-being,” the center found.     That level of division has spurred activists on both sides of the political divide to take their activism in a more confrontational direction.     In the wake of Trump’s victory, protesters on the left took to the streets by the thousands in cities across the country, in some cases causing property damage.  Much of the agitation was motivated by a belief that Trump’s administration will foster racism and push the courts and other political institutions to disenfranchise minority voters, says James Anderson, editor of ItsGoingDown.Org, an anarchist website that has promoted mass demonstrations against Trump’s presidency, including a call to disrupt his inauguration.     Many on the left have come to distrust government institutions, embracing a breed of activism aimed at directly confronting what they see as condemnable political forces, Anderson says. “The answer now is to organize, build power and autonomy and fight back.”     On the opposite end of the political spectrum, Trump’s election is bringing new hope for right-wing activists who felt abandoned by the major parties.      John Roberts, a top officer in the Ku Klux Klan affiliate planning the December rally to celebrate Trump’s election, says the group is committed to non-violent demonstrations, but he sees Trump’s election as likely to bring a new era of political conflict. And much of the strife, he says, will be centered around racial divisions.     “Once Trump officially takes office, there is going to be a boiling over at some point in time,” Roberts says. “Who knows when that’s going to be, but it’s not going to be pretty.”",politicsNews,"November 23, 2016 ",1
12577,BREAKING: DEVICE THAT BUSTED HILLARY CLINTON Discovered To Have Tens Of Thousands Of Emails,"Here s why Clinton and Abedin should be flipping out: Multiple State employees  told the FBI that they considered emailing Abedin  the equivalent of e-mailing Clinton.  Another close Clinton aide told the FBI that  Abedin may have kept emails that Clinton did not. The electronic device shared by Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin and husband Anthony Weiner on which the FBI found more Clinton emails was a laptop and it contained tens-of-thousands of emails, a senior law enforcement official told Fox News on Saturday.The FBI announced Friday that it had restarted an investigation into emails Clinton sent on a private server system while secretary of state, as a result of a probe into Abedin s husband, disgraced New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner,  sexting,  of sending sexually-suggestive electronic messages, to a teenage girl.The law enforcement official told Fox News that the laptop had  five digits  of emails, meaning tens-of-thousands of them. However, federal investigators remain unclear whether Abedin or Weiner own the laptop.The FBI conducted a roughly two-year investigation into Clinton s use of a private server system, finding several emails marked as classified and concluded that she had been  extremely careless.  However, the agency did not find evidence that Clinton had been criminally negligent and did not recommend criminal charges to the Justice Department.People familiar with the case say it was restarted by the FBI because the agency thought the new emails were  pertinent to the investigation. The source also told Fox News that law enforcement officials think it s highly unlikely that all of the new-found emails are duplicates, as the Clinton campaign has suggested.Read more: FOX News",politics,"Oct 29, 2016",1
10160,Sanders says party leaders may 'rethink' after wins,"Fresh from Democratic presidential primary wins over the weekend in three U.S. states, Bernie Sanders said on Sunday he had  political momentum that could help him win the backing of Democratic power brokers in his race against Hillary Clinton. Sanders easily won nominating contests in Alaska, Washington and Hawaii on Saturday. His latest remarks reflect his plan to chip away at Clinton’s commanding lead in the number of delegates needed to win the party’s nomination for the November election. Interviewed on Sunday by U.S. broadcasters, Sanders said Democratic “super-delegates,” who can change their allegiance, might face pressure to rally behind him because most polls suggest he has a better chance than Clinton of beating a Republican candidate. “Momentum is with us,” Sanders, a senator from Vermont, said on CNN’S State of the Union news program. “A lot of these super-delegates may rethink their position with Hillary Clinton.” Sanders also criticized Clinton’s reliance on wealthy donors to fund her campaign. He cited a fundraising dinner being hosted next month by actor George Clooney, where supporters will have to donate at least $33,400 to attend, or $353,400, nearly seven times the annual median income, if they want “premium” seating. “It is obscene that Secretary Clinton keeps going to big money people to fund her campaign,” Sanders told CNN. “Our events, we charge $15 or $50 for people to come.  So, it’s not a criticism of Clooney. It’s a criticism of a corrupt finance system.” About 85 percent of the votes at the July 25-28 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where a party nominee will be chosen to face the Republicans in the Nov. 8 election, are being determined by state nominating contests. The other 15 percent is held by party power brokers who are free to vote as they like, meaning they could hold the key in a tight contest. Super-delegates include party leaders and elected senators, members of the U.S. Congress and governors.  After Saturday’s contests, the former secretary of state led Sanders by just under 300 pledged delegates in the race for the 2,382 needed to be nominated.  Adding in the support of super-delegates, which the party created in the early 1980s to give leaders more control over the nominating process, Clinton had 1,712 delegates to 1,004 for Sanders, according to a tally by RealClearPolitics.com. The U.S. senator from Vermont needs to win up to two-thirds of the remaining delegates to catch Clinton, who will keep piling up delegates even when she loses under a Democratic Party system that awards them proportionally in all states.   Sanders is turning his attention to his native New York, where Democratic voters will divide up 247 delegates on April 19th. His campaign manager on Sunday wrote a letter to Clinton’s manager insisting that a planned televised debate between the candidates in April be held in the state, which Clinton represented as a U.S. senator for eight years. Jeff Weaver said in the letter that the Clinton campaign had resisted holding the debate in New York.   “Is the Secretary concerned about debating before the people who twice elected her to the U.S. Senate?” Weaver wrote. Spokesmen for Clinton did not respond to requests for comment.",politicsNews,"March 27, 2016 ",0
2385,Muhammad Ali’s Son Detained At Airport Because His Name Sounds Too Muslim,"Immigration officials in Florida proved how out of control things are in Trump s America by detaining the son of Muhammad Ali because his name happens to sound too Muslim for their liking.Muhammad Ali Jr. and his mother, Khalilah Camacho-Ali, were on their way home after speaking at a Black History Month event in Montego Bay, Jamaica. On Feb. 7, they flew into Fort Lauderdale, Florida. And then things took a disturbing turn.Chris Mancini, a lawyer and friend of the family says they were pulled to the side as they were going through customs. Khalilah Camacho-Ali was released when she pulled out a photo of her with the legendary boxer, but Muhammad Ali Jr. didn t have such a photo. Apparently, being related to a famous person would have meant more to officials than the fact that he s an American citizen with a U.S. passport to prove it.Ali Jr. was held by immigration officials and questioned for almost two hours. Where did you get your name from?  they asked him over and over. When they asked him if he was a Muslim, he said yes, and that really set off alarm bells for officials. They continued to question him about his religion and repeatedly asked him where he was born. Just for the record, he was born in Philadelphia in 1971.USA Today reports:While Ali Jr. was detained, Camacho-Ali ran around the airport asking,  Where s my son?  and begging for help, according to Mancini. Because incidents involving customs officials are considered to be on federal soil, local police had no jurisdiction to help her. Ali Jr. was eventually released two hours later, and the family contacted Mancini the following day.They have both traveled all over the world and never, ever, have they been subjected to this kind of treatment, said Mancini.  To the Ali family, it s crystal clear that this is directly linked to Mr. Trump s efforts to ban Muslims from the United States,  he added. Imagine walking into an airport and being asked about your religion,  he said.  This is classic customs profiling. According to Mancini, the Ali family is debating whether or not to file a federal lawsuit and are searching for others who have been subjected to this kind of racial profiling and harassment.Featured image via Andrew H.

1125,Mike Pence Indicates That He’ll Soon Be In The Russian Hot Seat,"There has been a lot of social media speculation over what will happen if and when Donald Trump is impeached or he is forced to resign. The Constitution, obviously, says that Mike Pence will be made President. Pence, it s assumed, will be a slightly better alternative. While he s anti-LGBT and anti-woman enough to be the inspiration for the Handmaid s Tale, he appears to be just bland enough to be called sane.Not so fast. He might be sane, but if his latest move is any indication, he could be going down with Trump and the rest of the people who are in bed with Russia. He has hired his own lawyer for the apparent inevitability of appearing under oath.The vice president s office said Thursday that Pence has retained Richard Cullen, a Richmond-based lawyer and chairman of McGuireWoods who previously served as a U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia.Pence s decision comes less than a month after Trump hired his own private attorney, Marc E. Kasowitz, to help navigate the investigations related to the Russia probe, and a day after The Washington Post reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is widening his investigation to examine whether the president attempted to obstruct justice.Source: Washington PostOf course, the act of hiring a lawyer in no way means Pence is guilty. What we do know, though, is that Pence knew from at least March that Trump s fired National Security Advisor, General Michael Flynn, was lobbying for a Turkish firm. Yes, there is evidence that policy changed because of Flynn s Turkish ties. Flynn had supposedly left that out when Pence was heading Trump s transition team.The White House, though, sat on that information for 18 days before firing Flynn.Again, hiring a lawyer does not mean guilt, but only three Vice Presidents have done so. Richard Nixon s VP, Spiro Agnew, hired one when he was under investigation for extortion, tax fraud, bribery and conspiracy. He ended up resigning, even before Watergate.Al Gore also hired counsel over questions about illegal fundraising. Dick Cheney hired counsel several times.The significant thing to note, though, is that none of the VPs hired counsel because their bosses were in trouble. They hired counsel because they were under fire. We can t be positive, but it s safe to assume that Pence will soon be testifying, and not just for his opinions.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"June 15, 2017",0

7778,Ex-Red Sox pitcher mulls run against Senator Warren in Massachusetts,"Former Boston Red Sox pitcher, failed video game entrepreneur and conservative political commentator Curt Schilling said on Tuesday he is considering running against Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in 2018. “I’ve made my decision. I’m going to run,” Schilling said during an interview on WPRO-AM radio in Providence, Rhode Island, about 40 miles from Boston. He added that the decision would be contingent on his wife’s approval. “Ultimately it’s going to come down to how her and I feel this would affect our marriage and our kids.” Schilling also fielded phone calls from listeners about a $75 million loan the state of Rhode Island made in 2010 to his video game company, 38 Studios, which went bankrupt in 2012. “I’m sorry it ended the way it did,” Schilling said, adding that if he had been governor of Rhode Island he would not have offered financing to that company. Schilling is still warmly remembered by Red Sox fans for undergoing a medical procedure that allowed him to pitch with an injured ankle and blood-stained sock during the American League Championship Series and World Series in 2004, helping the team win its first world series championship since 1918. Despite being associated with a team from a politically liberal state, Schilling has long backed conservative politicians, most recently Republican presidential contender Donald Trump.",politicsNews,"October 18, 2016 ",0
2018,"Republican Kasich, Democrat Hickenlooper mull joint White House run: media","Ohio’s Republican governor, John Kasich, and Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, have discussed the idea of a joint run for the White House in 2020, Axios and CNN reported on Friday. Citing an unidentified source, CNN said the discussions were not at an organizational level for a bid, which would challenge Republican President Donald Trump’s expected re-election campaign and complicate Democratic efforts to regain the White House. “What they are trying to show the country is that honorable people can disagree, but you can still problem solve together,” it quoted the source as saying. Kasich, who was among more than a dozen Republican candidates to be defeated by Trump in last year’s presidential primary campaign, would top the ticket, according to CNN and Axios online news outlet. Kasich adviser John Weaver told Reuters the two governors “have an outstanding working relationship” and had “done a great job” showing how two people from different parties can work together. “That model can work on other issues,” said Weaver, who did not say the reports were inaccurate. Trump, a real estate developer and former reality television star who has an approval rating below 40 percent after seven months in office, has held a series of re-election campaign events. Earlier this month Vice President Mike Pence denied a New York Times report that he is preparing for a 2020 presidential run, saying the suggestion was “disgraceful and offensive.” A spokeswoman for Hickenlooper did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hickenlooper and Kasich are working on a proposal to stabilize the health insurance markets, and Axios said they plan to extend their joint platform to include immigration and job creation. Kasich, whose state opted to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, has criticized some of the so-far unsuccessful Republican efforts to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act,  passed under Democratic President Barack Obama. He said in an interview with National Public Radio aired this week that the possibility of national single-payer health coverage is not part of his discussions with Hickenlooper. Their jobs plan “will focus on the coming displacement from automation, with prescriptions that include trade, workforce training — and an optimistic and hopeful message, balanced with an honest admission that some jobs just aren’t coming back,” Axios said.",politicsNews,"August 25, 2017 ",0

4285,WATCH: Chuck Todd HUMILIATES Rudy Giuliani After He Pathetically Defends Trump,"Appearing on NBC s Meet The Press Sunday morning, Rudy Giuliani continued his efforts to defend Donald Trump. With Trump s campaign falling apart and the rest of the GOP quickly abandoning their presidential nominee, Giulini has continued to stump for Trump despite the fact that Trump is now being skewered by both Democrats and Republicans over his violently misogynistic remarks regarding groping women.It didn t take very long for the show s host Chuck Todd to show what it means to be a friend of Trump at the moment. Giuliani, who recently defended Trump s  grab her by the pussy  comment by saying that  The fact is men, at times, talk like that,  was forced to listen to audio recordings where Trump used vile misogynistic language. Because his cognitive dissonance apparently knows no limits, Giuliani offered another pathetic attempt to defend Trump. Still, he wasn t running for president,  Giulini says.Todd responds perfectly saying: Oh, he wasn t running for president so it s OK to be a misogynist. He wasn t running for president so it s OK to make unwanted sexual advances? That s a good counterpoint to have on hand for the rest of the election. Assuming Trump doesn t drop out of the race, his campaign is going to desperately try to position him as a reformed sinner, to appeal to moderate Christian right. A critical demographic of consistent voters Trump needs in toss-up states.At that point, Giuliani tried desperately to pivot to talking about recently leaked portions of transcripts from paid speeches that Hillary Clinton gave. Todd then asks Giulini an excellent question that proves that Giuliani had just bit himself on the ass with that pivot attempt. If you believe that Hillary Clinton says one thing in private and that means what she really is, is what she is in private, should we assume what Donald Trump did   is really what Donald Trump is like in private?

17419,"Drone hits commercial airliner in Canada, no injuries","A drone hit an airplane landing at a Quebec City airport this week, the first time an unmanned flying object has collided with commercial aircraft in Canada, Transport Minister Marc Garneau said on Sunday. No injuries were reported in the incident, which happened on Thursday at Jean Lesage International Airport and involved a plane belonging to Quebec-based Skyjet Aviation.  I am extremely relieved that the aircraft only sustained minor damage and was able to land safely,  Garneau said in a statement. There were six passengers and two crew members on board the airplane at the time of the collision, according to local news media reports. Drones are not allowed within 5.5 km (3.4 miles) of Canadian airports, helipads and seaplane bases. Operators who put aircraft at risk face steep fines and jail time under Canadian law. Drone usage has soared in North America, Europe and China, raising privacy concerns and fears of collisions with commercial jets, and prompting the United Nations  aviation agency to back the creation of a single global drone registry. There have been 1,596 drone incidents reported to Transport Canada so far this year, with 131 of them deemed to be aviation safety concerns. In November 2016, a Canadian airliner with 54 passengers on board had to swerve to avoid an unmanned flying object near Toronto, slightly injuring two cabin crew.",worldnews,"October 15, 2017 ",1

13874,Vietnam prosecutes bank officials in corruption crackdown,"Vietnam has prosecuted five former officials of the unlisted Dong A Bank for violating rules that  lead to serious consequences , police said on Friday, part of a widening investigation involving the Ho Chi Minh City-based lender. Energy and banking firms are at the heart of a sweeping crackdown on corruption in the communist state, a campaign that made global headlines this year when Germany accused Vietnam of kidnapping a Vietnamese businessman in Berlin. The troubled, partly private Dong A Bank is among several lenders under scrutiny of the authorities who say they want to tackle corruption, including abuse of power and violation of lending rules.  The Investigation Police Department of the Ministry of Public Security is urgently investigating the case,  police said in a statement.  Abuse of trust to appropriate assets, deliberate violation of state regulations on economic management that led to serious consequences and the violation of lending provisions ... occurred at Dong A Commercial Joint Stock Bank (DAB),  police  said. The five former officials were banned from leaving their homes, police said. Dong A Bank said it would respond to a Reuters request for comment later in the day. The bank s former chief executive officer Tran Phuong Binh was arrested in 2016 along with four other executives. The central bank, the State Bank of Vietnam, had placed Dong A Bank under special supervision in 2015  for violations in financial management and credit grants  by some executives.

What would we do without them-they have pushed for the truth on so many things about Benghazi but other things that have happened during the lawless Obama years. Thanks to Judicial Watch for finally getting to the bottom of this!Judicial Watch Docs Reveal Obama Admin KNEW Al Qaeda Terrorists Planned Benghazi 10 Days In Advance (Washington, DC)   Judicial Watch announced today that it obtained more than 100 pages of previously classified  Secret  documents from the Department of Defense (DOD)and the Department of State revealing that DOD almost immediately reported that the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was committed by the al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood-linked  Brigades of the Captive Omar Abdul Rahman  (BCOAR), and had been planned at least 10 days in advance. Rahman is known as the Blind Sheikh, and is serving life in prison for his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other terrorist acts. The new documents also provide the first official confirmation that shows the U.S. government was aware of arms shipments from Benghazi to Syria. The documents also include an August 2012 analysis warning of the rise of ISIS and the predicted failure of the Obama policy of regime change in Syria.The documents were released in response to a court order in accordance with a May 15, 2014, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed against both the DOD and State Department seeking communications between the two agencies and congressional leaders  on matters related to the activities of any agency or department of the U.S. government at the Special Mission Compound and/or classified annex in Benghazi.

The document was sent to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Obama White House National Security Council.

5199,"In speech, Trump tries to turn from divisive to deal-maker","U.S. President Donald Trump showed a different side in his first address to Congress. This Trump was part deal-maker, part salesman, asking for unity and trying to repackage his populist message in more palatable terms.  He was less combative, less thin-skinned and more inclusive.  And where five weeks ago at his inauguration, he slammed Washington’s politicians as out-of-touch elitists who prospered at the expense of the public, his message on Tuesday night was different: I need you, Republicans and Democrats alike. Always a showman, the reality TV star-turned-politician laid out plenty of promises: A massive infrastructure and public works program; tax cuts for the middle class; immigration reform; a healthcare overhaul; an education bill. All of it would require congressional action, likely by different coalitions of conservatives, moderates and Democrats.  “This is our vision. This is our mission,” Trump said. “But we can only get there together.” Trump, a Republican who has taunted Democrats over his 2016 election victory and publicly fumed as they held up his Cabinet nominees, did not criticize them this time. Repeatedly, he asked for their help, arguing that the country’s problems call for bipartisan solutions.  After weeks of attacks on the media, political rivals and the judges who ruled against his executive order to temporarily ban travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, Trump finally eased off, although his proposals were short on specifics. “It was a softer tone and he gave a speech and not a tweet and that’s more suitable when you’re president of the United States,” said Democratic Representative Peter Welch. “The challenges are going to be the details on his policies.” “He was presidential tonight in a way he has not been before this,” said Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak. The address appeared to show some recognition by the White House that Trump’s bombastic go-it-alone style has its limits. After a parade of executive orders, Trump must now turn his attention to the big-ticket items on his agenda requiring legislative action.  “He’s done all he can unilaterally,” said Bradley Blakeman, a former aide to President George W. Bush. “Now he needs to pass bills.” Even though Republicans control Congress, Blakeman said Trump needs Democrats to build a majority that would allow conservative Republicans to oppose some of his more centrist proposals, such as hefty infrastructure spending and talks on immigration reform.  “The president is as transactional a person as we’ve ever seen,” Blakeman said. “He understands that you might not like this deal, but I need you for three other deals.”  Despite the softer tone, Trump’s divisive policies and months of hostile rhetoric will not be forgotten by his adversaries. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, in a round of television interviews on Wednesday morning, dismissed Trump’s speech as detached from reality, saying the softer tone did not match the administration’s hard-line agenda presented so far. “His speeches are populist. They’re aimed at the working folks who supported him. But his governing and what he does is hard right, favoring special interests over the working class,” Schumer told CBS. Nancy Pelosi, the leading Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, told MSNBC that Trump gave a good sales pitch but has offered little in the way of concrete proposals: “All they have is rhetoric. We don’t have any reality in terms of any legislation.” Congressional Democrats said they liked Trump’s infrastructure program, his childcare tax credit, his call to reduce the prices of prescription drugs, and his vow to preserve some key elements of former President Barack Obama’s signature 2010 health insurance law. Democrats remain troubled, among other things, by Trump’s desire to slash domestic programs to increase military spending, his plans to reduce taxes for the wealthy and corporations, as well as his aggressive policy to deport illegal immigrants.   To be sure, the more foreboding elements of Trump’s campaign rhetoric were still present, albeit slightly dialed-down. As he did during the campaign, he portrayed a country in ruinous economic shape and plagued by terrorism, drugs, gangs, and illegal immigrants. In coming days, the White House is likely to release a revised version of its travel ban, reigniting a controversy that overshadowed the first weeks of Trump’s presidency. [nL2N1GE0SB] Trump came into the address struggling with public opinion. In an interview with Fox News he acknowledged that he and his staff had not been effective communicators. The most recent Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll found about 48 percent of Americans disapproved of Trump’s performance, with 46 percent backing him, poor numbers for a new president.  Mackowiak said Trump’s address could reverse his fortunes in a “crucial moment” for his presidency. “His public support will improve from this speech,” he said.   But John Geer, a public-opinion expert at Vanderbilt University, was not convinced. “He’s going to have to do more than give a speech.”",politicsNews,"March 1, 2017 ",0

15208,Virginia heavy metal band strikes chord with Catalonia anthem,"A tiny basement in a house in suburban Washington, D.C. reverberates with music from the Spanish region of Catalonia. A heavy metal rendition of the Catalonian national anthem  Els Segadors,  or  The Reapers  has turned a virtually unknown Virginia-based band, A Sound of Thunder, into celebrities in the politically sensitive region in northeastern Spain. Within days of its release, the song racked up more than a million hits on YouTube, making it the band s most popular single since they started in 2008.  Thousands of Catalonians voted for independence from Spain during a banned referendum in October that ended in violence and spurred a constitutional crisis in the euro zone s fourth-biggest economy.  Back in Manassas, Virginia, Nina Osegueda, the band s lead singer, made a quick decision to release a video of the band s version of  Els Segadors  on Youtube. Osegueda, whose mother is Catalan, has strong ties to the region and originally recorded the anthem as a tribute to her mother. The song was never intended to be released as a single, but instead was part of the band s new full-length album,  It Was Metal,  to be released in March 2018. The violence that surrounded the referendum vote changed all that.  We have a couple other singles that we were planning on releasing in advance to show people what the new album is going to sound like,  she said.  But then the vote happened and 800 people were injured by the police trying to vote. So I said we should try and just put the song out to show our support against police brutality.   Suddenly it was spreading all over the place... And then I noticed that someone shared us on Twitter and it wound up actually being a Catalan politician,  Osegueda said. Music stations in Catalonia picked up the song and Osegueda was interviewed on several radio shows. The attention she has received has spread to her relatives as her Catalonian uncle was interviewed on local radio.  On the band s YouTube page, fans have left messages saying they prefer the metal version to the original and many have said the song has struck an emotional chord.  Osegueda recorded some parts of the song in Catalan. She doesn t speak the language and singing with proper pronunciation was intimidating, but she says the enthusiasm and support from her new found fans has been humbling.  I think the biggest emotional response we ve gotten has been,  it brought me to tears which is not normal for a heavy metal song . So for us that was like a big deal,  Osegueda said.  You know, we re not on a label. We do everything ourselves. So when we see this many people responding it s like it s overwhelming.  The band, whose albums have been crowdfunded through various Kickstarter campaigns, will tour Catalonia for the first time in December, just days before regional elections on Dec. 21. They have shows planned in Barcelona, Tarragona and other Catalonian cities.  For Osegueda, who has traveled to Catalonia a number of times, the upcoming visit feels different.  I ve always enjoyed going there on vacation. But now it s a lot deeper because there s so many people out there who saw our song as inspiration. So I feel like I definitely have a deeper connection now,  she said.",worldnews,"November 9, 2017 ",0

The $21 million Hillary pulled down from speaking engagements on Wall Street over a 2 year period might have something to do with it as well .This week at the Democratic National Convention, much of the focus was not on nominee Hillary Clinton, but on Bernie Sanders and his enthusiastic contingent of young supporters.While some had speculated that Sanders supporters would fall in line after his endorsement of Clinton, it appears that this consolidation has yet to gain any momentum.Bernie supporters, emboldened by the recent DNC email leak, took to the streets in Philadelphia to voice their displeasure with Hillary and the Democrat party as a whole.With chants of  Hell no DNC, we won t vote for Hillary  and  Lock her up,  the protesters made it clear they would not be casting their votes for Hillary Clinton.

15801,Exclusive: Trump boosts disaster aid for Puerto Rico rebuild,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday agreed to expand the use of disaster aid to help rebuild Puerto Rico s power grid and other infrastructure wrecked by Hurricane Maria, the White House said. In a unique agreement recognizing both the massive devastation on the island and its dire financial problems, aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for infrastructure projects will be released in a faster, more flexible way than is typical after disasters, a senior White House official told Reuters. The plan, agreed to with Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, will also provide for third-party advisers to estimate how much money is requires for big-ticket projects, and how it is spent - a provision aimed at protecting taxpayer dollars in what is expected to be a massive, long-term effort to rebuild the island.  We re doing it in a way that grants flexibility, but also imposes a mutually agreed upon set of controls,  the official said in an interview. The new agreement will see FEMA cover 90 percent of the costs for rebuilding public infrastructure, up from the typical level of 75 percent. Puerto Rico - home to 3.4 million Americans - is in bankruptcy, struggling with $72 billion in debt. Its finances were put under federal control last year. Six weeks after Hurricane Maria hit, only about 30 percent of Puerto Rico s power grid has been restored. Private sector estimates of total damage from Maria have ranged as high as $95 billion. The White House is expected to deliver a new request for disaster aid to the U.S. Congress in mid-November to help defray costs from Maria and two other major hurricanes - Harvey and Irma - as well as damage caused by wildfires in the western United States. It is not yet clear how big the federal tab for Puerto Rico will be.  Obviously it s going to be a big dollar figure,  the official said.  I know there won t be any balking at the amount of money needed from the administration.  Even with FEMA covering 90 percent of the costs, it could be difficult for the territorial government to put up its 10 percent. On top of its fiscal constraints, the storm has ground its economy - and tax revenues - to a halt. The federal government provided a $150 million loan in an aid package approved by Congress last month that can be used to help cover its share, the official said.          We didn t want to create the precedent of giving 100 percent in the grant program and then disincentivizing good stewardship,  the official said. The federal government will also use relatively new procedures created in 2013 after Hurricane Sandy known as  Section 428  in the Stafford Act, the law that provides for federal disaster aid.  It s not been used on this scale before,  the official said. The procedures will allow Puerto Rico to estimate the costs of big projects up front - with help from third-party advisers - and draw down from approved grants, eliminating the slow and cumbersome process of being reimbursed for upfront spending on each segment. The agreement will also allow Puerto Rico to access hazard mitigation grants - normally tapped only outside of disasters - while rebuilding the creaky power grid and other infrastructure so that the structures are more resilient to future hurricanes.  We re going to build them back smarter,  the official said.",worldnews,"November 2, 2017 ",1

18666,ISLAMIC JUSTICE: Britain Is Stunned When They Discover How Many Secret Sharia Courts Are Operating In UK,"Like dominoes, the Hijra keeps marching across Europe, destroying the distinct cultures of one country after another. Sweden and the UK are in big trouble France is next and thanks to bleeding heart liberal Democrats in America, the U.S. isn t be far behind At least 85 Islamic sharia courts are operating in Britain, a study claimed yesterday.The astonishing figure is 17 times higher than previously accepted.The tribunals, working mainly from mosques, settle financial and family disputes according to religious principles. They lay down judgments which can be given full legal status if approved in national law courts.However, they operate behind doors that are closed to independent observers and their decisions are likely to be unfair to women and backed by intimidation, a report by independent think-tank Civitas said.Commentators on the influence of sharia law often count only the five courts in London, Manchester, Bradford, Birmingham and Nuneaton that are run by the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal, a body whose rulings are enforced through the state courts under the 1996 Arbitration Act.But the study by academic and Islamic specialist Denis MacEoin estimates there are at least 85 working tribunals.The spread of sharia law has become increasingly controversial since its role was backed last year by Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams and Lord Phillips, the Lord Chief Justice who stepped down last October.Dr Williams said a recognised role for sharia law seemed  unavoidable  and Lord Phillips said there was no reason why decisions made on sharia principles should not be recognised by the national courts.But the Civitas report said the principles on which sharia courts work are indicated by the fatwas   religious decrees   set out on websites run by British mosques.Mr MacEoin said:  Among the rulings we find some that advise illegal actions and others that transgress human rights standards as applied by British courts. Examples set out in his study include a ruling that no Muslim woman may marry a non-Muslim man unless he converts to Islam and that any children of a woman who does should be taken from her until she marries a Muslim.Further rulings, according to the report, approve polygamous marriage and enforce a woman s duty to have sex with her husband on his demand.The report added:  The fact that so many sharia rulings in Britain relate to cases concerning divorce and custody of children is of particular concern, as women are not equal in sharia law, and sharia contains no specific commitment to the best interests of the child that is fundamental to family law in the UK. Under sharia, a male child belongs to the father after the age of seven, regardless of circumstances. It said:  Sharia courts operating in Britain may be handing down rulings that are inappropriate to this country because they are linked to elements in Islamic law that are seriously out of step with trends in Western legislation. WATCH Muslims demand Shari Law in Britain:The Civitas study said the Islamic courts should no longer be recognised under British law.Its director Dr David Green said:  The reality is that for many Muslims, sharia courts are in practice part of an institutionalised atmosphere of intimidation, backed by the ultimate sanction of a death threat. Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said:  Everyone should be deeply concerned about the extent of these courts. They do entrench division in society, and do nothing to entrench integration or community cohesion. It leads to a segregated society. There should be one law, and that should be British law. We can t have a situation where people can choose which system of law they follow and which they do not. We can t have a situation where people choose the system of law which they feel gives them the best outcome. Everyone should equal under one law.

8583,Trump to Clinton: 'No more Mr. Nice Guy',"U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he was taking the gloves off in his battle against Democrat Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House after taking a scorching from speakers at the Democratic National Convention. Trump wrapped up a five-day, seven-state campaign swing in Colorado on Friday, where for a fifth straight day his supporters chanted “lock her up” whenever he brought up Clinton’s name. Trump supporters say Clinton deserves to be prosecuted for her handling of U.S. foreign policy as President Barack Obama’s first-term secretary of state and for her use of a private email server while in that office. All week Trump has sought to tamp down the chants by stressing that his main goal is to simply beat Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. But as the crowd chanted the slogan in Colorado Springs, Trump finally relented. “I’m starting to agree with you, frankly,” he said. “No more Mr. Nice Guy.” In Denver later, he changed his tune when he heard the chant. “I’ll tell you what I’d rather do, honestly, is just beat her on Nov. 8 at the polls. She would be a disaster,” he said. Trump was a punching bag at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, which wrapped up Thursday night, as speaker after speaker - including some Republicans - said he lacked the temperament to be president. Clinton herself said in her acceptance speech that the election represented a “moment of reckoning” for the country. In Colorado Springs, Trump got sidetracked by a couple of disputes from last year as he tried to rebut a Clinton campaign ad. That ad uses video clip from Trump’s attack on Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly in protest of her questioning of him at a debate of Republican presidential contenders last August when he said afterward that blood was “coming out of her eyes, coming out of her wherever.” “I was talking about her nose,” Trump said in Colorado Springs. “I wanted to get back on the issue of taxes” at the debate. Trump also brought up the case of disabled New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, whom Trump seemed to mock publicly in video used by the Clinton ad. Trump said he was depicting the reporter groveling to him. “I didn’t know he was disabled. I didn’t know it at all. I had no idea,” he said.",politicsNews,"July 30, 2016 ",1
8534,Conservatives Are Going BONKERS Over the Indictment Of The Fake ‘Baby Parts’ Video People (SCREENSHOTS),"In case you haven t heard, after Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into Planned Parenthood after disingenuous, heavily-edited videos were produced by the deceptively-named Center For Medical Progress. The videos, which claimed the women s health organization sold  baby parts  to the highest bidder, launched a wave of investigations nationwide   all of which turned up absolutely no wrongdoing on the part of Planned Parenthood.One such investigation in Texas involved Planned Parenthood of the Gulf Coast. Though a grand jury cleared the much-maligned institution of any and all wrongdoing, two indictments were handed down   against the producers of the anti-Planned Parenthood fabrications.David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt were both indicted for Tampering with a Governmental Record. In addition, Daleiden received an indictment for Prohibition of the Purchase and Sale of Human Organs   an incredibly serious charge. We were called upon to investigate allegations of criminal conduct by Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast,  said Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson.  As I stated at the outset of this investigation, we must go where the evidence leads us. All the evidence uncovered in the course of this investigation was presented to the grand jury. I respect their decision on this difficult case. The people behind this fraud lied and broke the law in order to spread malicious lies about Planned Parenthood to advance their extreme anti-abortion political agenda,  Planned Parenthood said in a statement.  As the dust settles and the truth comes out, it s become totally clear that the only people who engaged in wrongdoing are the criminals behind this fraud, and we re glad they are being held accountable. Nothing about today s announcement in Harris County impacts the state s ongoing investigation,  said Governor Abbott, who promised to continue to waste state money in fruitless attempts to smear the women s health group.  The State of Texas will continue to protect life, and I will continue to support legislation prohibiting the sale or transfer of fetal tissue. The horrific nature of these videos demand scrutiny and investigation. The Senate Committee on Health and Human Services will continue to examine the practices of abortion providers and whether state law adequately protects the sanctity of life,  Lt. gov. Dan Patrick added. I will never be deterred from standing up to fight to protect the unborn. Daleiden s supporters similarly don t care about the facts, with many demanding an investigation into the grand jury because they can t possibly think that laws were broken when the Center for Medical Progress illegally recorded privileged information and slopping edited clips together to give the impression of wrongdoing   no matter what the evidence says. On Fox News  Facebook page, they let their  thoughts  (we use that word loosely) be known:               It s important to remember that these people will be voting in November.Featured image via screengrab",News,"January 26, 2016",1

7299,Zuckerberg again rejects claims of Facebook impact on U.S. election,"Facebook Inc chief executive Mark Zuckerberg again rejected the idea that the social network affected the U.S. presidential election, saying late Saturday it is “extremely unlikely” news hoaxes changed the outcome. Ensnared in a string of content controversies in recent months, Facebook has insisted that it is a technology company, not a media firm. But scrutiny of the site has heightened since the surprise election of Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday, with critics alleging the site helped spread lies via fake news stories and hoaxes.  Zuckerberg has vehemently defended the network against such criticism, calling the idea that Facebook affected the election  “crazy” at a conference on Thursday. He echoed that stance in his late Saturday post, though he said the company would do more to prevent fake news.  Such hoaxes represent a sliver of content shared on Facebook and because they are not limited to partisan views or politics, it is unlikely they could have changed the election’s outcome, Zuckerberg said. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,” he said, noting the network’s goal is to “give every person a voice.” Still, Facebook has launched work to enable people to flag hoaxes and fake news, the statement said. Facebook has faced a number of content controversies this year, including international outcry after it removed an iconic Vietnam War photo due to nudity, a decision that was later reversed. The thorniest content issues are decided by a group of top executives at Facebook. Questions over content policing have returned to the fore in the tense days since the election, which has led to protests against Trump and his proposed policies in major U.S. cities. Ahead of the Nov. 8 election, Facebook users saw fake news reports erroneously alleging that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead. Senior management have launched a conversation to examine Facebook’s involvement in affecting opinions and votes, The New York Times reported on Saturday, saying a group of vice presidents and executives began discussing late Tuesday the company’s role in the election’s outcome.  Facebook’s policy team was called together and the firm plans to address staff concerns at a broader meeting, the paper reported, citing anonymous sources.  Facebook representatives were not immediately available to comment on the report. “After the election, many people are asking whether fake news contributed to the result, and what our responsibility is to prevent fake news from spreading,” Zuckerberg said on Saturday.  “These are very important questions and I care deeply about getting them right.”",politicsNews,"November 13, 2016 ",0
152,"U.S. tax bill to preserve key renewable energy credits, sources say","The final version of comprehensive tax legislation being negotiated by House and Senate lawmakers will preserve key renewable energy tax credits that were once at risk of being removed, congressional and business sources said on Thursday. Congressional Republicans reached a deal on tax legislation on Wednesday, clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent and cut taxes for wealthy Americans. Congressional and business sources briefed on the status of these talks have confirmed that the production tax credit for wind energy and the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit, which the House version of the bill had targeted, will remain in the final bill. Lawmakers have been working to produce a tax package after the Republican-controlled House and Senate passed different versions of legislation.  The president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, Gregory Wetstone, sent a note to members on Wednesday saying that he knew “with certainty” that the legislation also did not include the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for corporations that would have reduced the value of the production tax credit (PTC) for wind projects. Meanwhile, the renewable energy industry is awaiting final details on how congressional negotiators will address problems created by a provision included in the Senate-passed bill called the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT). This measure was intended to prevent multinational companies from abusing the tax code but would make tax credits like the PTC for wind less valuable. This provision would have chilled investment by international companies like Vestas, and banks in the renewable energy sector, industry experts said. Wetstone said negotiators are working on a fix that would allow the PTC to offset at least 80 percent of the BEAT tax imposed on multinational companies. Another source briefed on the negotiations said that as much as 90 percent of credits could be used to offset the BEAT tax. “We are still unclear about the precise terms of deal, but it’s good news for the whole sector,” said Liam Donovan, a lobbyist with Bracewell focused on tax, infrastructure and energy.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2017 ",0

7505,Why A Wall Street Investor Endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders,"Asher Edelman inspired the character Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone s 1987 film, Wall Street, played by Michael Douglas. The infamous stockbroker, who made a fortune buying and selling companies in distress, was recently asked on CNBC s Fast Money, who he would endorse for Bernie Sanders. His answer was surprising, but his reasoning is not: Bernie Sanders, no question,  said Edelman. ,  I think it s quite simple again. If you look at something called  velocity of money  That means how much gets spent and turns around. When you have the top one percent getting money, they spend five-ten percent of what they earn. When you have the lower end of the economy getting money, they spend a hundred, or a hundred and ten percent of what they earn. As you ve had a transfer of wealth to the top, and a transfer of income to the top, you have a shrinking consumer base, basically, and you have a shrinking velocity of money. Edelman argued redistributing wealth, especially at the point we are at now with levels of income and wealth inequalities continually growing, is what is best for the economy. Greed and corruption may allow the wealthiest to gain short term profits, but as the middle class disappears and the working class becomes ever burdened, the economy begins to sputter into stagnation.Senator Bernie Sanders  economic policies aren t radical, socialist, or unrealistic. They are simply what is needed to be implemented to fix a broken, rigged economy. Edelman may be a member of the top one percent, but he is intelligent enough to realize trickle down economics doesn t work, and the Republicans who insist on perpetuating economic policies surrounding that myth continue to damage the United States economy.The rich getting richer don t create jobs, customers do. If there aren t any customers to purchase goods and services, such as a middle and working class who earn enough to have disposable income, the economy will falter.Featured image via Addicting Info archives",News,"March 14, 2016",1

14503,At least five killed in Kenya as violence greets opposition leader's return,"At least five people were killed on Friday as Kenyan police tried to disperse supporters accompanying opposition leader Raila Odinga from the airport to central Nairobi, police said.     Police fired tear gas at the convoy in which Odinga was traveling and used water cannon as they tried to stop it reaching the capital s main business district. Some protesters threw stones at police. Two vehicles, including a police truck, were set on fire. A Reuters photographer saw two bodies with gunshot wounds as police and protesters fought on one of the main roads leading to the business district. Police said five people were stoned to death by angry mobs after they were caught stealing and denied they had used excessive force against the opposition supporters.  These incidences occurred before the police arrived at the various scenes,  the police service said in a statement. Police retreated several times along the route after the protesters were unmoved by the teargas and water cannon spray. They finally held their ground near the city s main park, where Odinga, just returned from the United States, intended to address a rally that had been banned. He blamed President Uhuru Kenyatta for the violence.  My anger is with that guy called Uhuru Kenyatta. I went abroad... After you welcomed me well, he sent policemen to teargas you, to beat my people, to fire bullets at them. Isn t this barbaric?,  he told his supporters after driving to safety. Odinga has called for a  National Resistance Movement  to protest against the outcome of a repeat presidential election last month which saw Kenyatta win a second, five-year term with 98 percent of the vote after Odinga boycotted the contest. Only 39 percent of registered voters took part. The repeat poll was ordered by the Supreme Court after it annulled the results of the August election, won by Kenyatta, over procedural irregularities. The court will rule on Monday on cases that seek to nullify the rerun election.  The political crisis has stirred fears for the stability of Kenya, a regional hub for trade, diplomacy and security.  Earlier on Friday, demonstrators threw up burning barricades on Mombasa Road, the highway that links Nairobi s downtown business district and the airport. Despite a partial police ban on protests in the capital, hundreds of people had gathered in the morning near Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to await Odinga s return. Police fired into the air to disperse them. Once Odinga landed, motorcycle taxi drivers and people on foot shouted their support as the motorcade, which included lawmakers from Odinga s opposition coalition, began moving toward central Nairobi. Dozens of international flights depart and arrive daily at Nairobi s main airport. The national airport authority said on Twitter just before midday that operations were running normally.  Kenya Airways said it had been  impacted  by the disruptions around the airport and offered to book travelers who missed their flights on subsequent ones.   Kenya s prolonged election season has disrupted its economy. Human rights groups say at least 66 people have died in bloodshed surrounding the two elections. Ahead of Monday s Supreme Court ruling, Kenya Airways  chairman told an investor briefing on Friday:  Hopefully we don t have another presidential election so we can get on with life.",worldnews,"November 17, 2017 ",0

In addition to wanting to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the new Republican president also intends to sign an executive order pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), NBC reported. Trump, who was sworn in as the 45th U.S. president on Friday, targeted both trade pacts during his White House campaign.  Officials were not immediately available to confirm the report to Reuters. Trump’s official schedule includes a 10:30  a.m. EST (1530 GMT) signing of executive orders in the Oval Office. The president said on Sunday he planned talks soon with the leaders of Canada and Mexico to begin renegotiating NAFTA. “We will be starting negotiations having to do with NAFTA,” Trump said at a swearing-in ceremony for his top White House advisers. “We are going to start renegotiating on NAFTA, on immigration and on security at the border.” Trump said during the campaign he wanted to secure more favorable terms for the United States in the NAFTA pact. NAFTA, which took effect in 1994, and other trade deals became lightning rods for voter anger in the U.S. industrial heartland states that swept Trump to victory. CNN reported the first executive action Trump intended to sign was to pull out of the TPP, the trade agreement among 11 Pacific Rim countries that Democratic President Barack Obama strongly backed but was never ratified by the Republican-controlled Congress.",politicsNews,"January 23, 2017 ",1
4869,WATCH: Hitler EXPLODES At Trump Campaign In Hilarious Video Mocking White Supremacist Rage,"As white supremacists whine about Donald Trump s flip-flop on immigration, someone kindly created a video of Adolf Hitler going batshit crazy about it.During an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, who has become the Republican nominee s chief propagandist, Trump backed away from his core promise to round up and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.Of course, all of the racists who support Trump s campaign immediately lost their small minds, with some even going so far as to threaten Trump if he doesn t keep his original promise.Ann Coulter even threw a fit about it and complained that Trump is talking about amnesty. So it looks like Coulter and the rest of Trump s hardcore supporters have lost a little trust in their candidate, which is hysterical since Coulter s new book is titled In Trump We Trust.To mock Trump s supporters, RINO Pundit used the Hitler biopic film Downfall and changed all of the subtitles to show the Nazi leader furiously throwing a temper tantrum over Trump s new immigration flap. Hannity, Coulter, Reince Priebus, Chris Christie, and Matt Drudge are all not spared from Hitler s wrath in this hilarious video.It begins with one of Hitler s advisers telling him that Trump could get through a full week without committing a gaffe since Coulter is starting her book tour.Hitler is relieved that Trump may finally be in the clear as long as he doesn t pivot on immigration too drastically. Then he is told of Trump s Hannity interview. Trump went full-blown amnesty on a Hannity special,  an adviser reluctantly informs the Fuhrer.Then the fun begins as Hitler asks everyone who predicted that Trump would flip-flop to leave the room.

4302,Western push at U.N. to boost backing for Syria gas attack inquiry,"The U.N. Security Council could vote as early as Wednesday on a push by the United States, Britain and France to bolster support for international inquiries into a deadly toxic gas attack in Syria, diplomats said, a move Russia had deemed unacceptable and unwarranted. The three countries have proposed a revised draft resolution, diplomats said, similar to a text they circulated to the 15-member council last week that condemns the April 4 attack and pushes Syria’s government to cooperate with investigators. Western powers blame the sarin gas attack, which killed scores of civilians - many of them children, on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces.  Syria’s government has denied responsibility for the attack, which prompted a U.S. strike on a Syrian air base. The Security Council vote would come at the end of a visit to Moscow by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. A senior Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the most likely scenario appeared to be a veto of the U.N. resolution by Syrian ally Russia. Russia said last week the draft resolution was unacceptable and unwarranted.  The senior diplomat said that last week the Chinese had been prepared to abstain in a vote. Russia is one of five council veto powers, along with China, the United States, Britain and France. “We cannot give up and we must try in good faith, the best we can, to have a text of the Security Council condemning the attack, asking for a thorough investigation,” French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre told reporters on Tuesday. An Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) fact-finding mission is already investigating the attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in a rebel-held area of northern Syria.

2256,Muslim Internment Flyers SHOCK Students Of UC San Diego With Stark Warning,"Students at the University of California, San Diego, were shocked this week when Muslim internment flyers were posted around the campus.NBC 7, a local channel in San Diego, report that the flyers were posted on billboards around the campus and  took the form of Internment Notices, which signaled the roundup of thousands of Japanese Americans during World War II. But these notices targeted Muslims. The poster read, in part: All Muslim persons, both alien and non-alien, will be evacuated from the above designated area by 12:00 o clock noon Wednesday, April 8, 2017. No Muslim person will be permitted to enter or leave the above described area after 8:00 a.m., Thursday, April 2, 2017, without obtaining special permission from the Provost Marshal at the Civil Control Station A person claiming responsibility for the flyers emailed NBC and explained that the posters were not intended to be  anti-Muslim.  Instead, the goal was to shock and anger people  by using our own shameful past of Japanese internment camps to warn people about the path we are currently on. The posters were meant to mimic the internment posters because I wanted to shock/anger people and to show them what could happen if they didn t do anything to stop it. It was a warning presented as a possible future,  the email read.The flyers appeared on the same day that Donald Trump signed his updated executive order banning citizens of several Muslim majority countries from entering the United States.This time, only six countries are included in the ban since Iraq has been excluded from the list. The updated version also outlines exclusions for valid visa holders, green card holders, and several other groups. Reportedly, Trump decided not to give preferential treatment to Christians in the updated ban either. To avoid the chaos the order created last time, there is a 10-day grace period before the bigoted ban kicks in on March 16.Featured image via Twitter and Wikimedia Commons",News,"March 6, 2017",0
4153,Group sues Trump for repealing U.S. wildlife rule in rare legal challenge,"An environmental group sued President Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday over the repeal of a U.S. rule intended to protect wildlife, in the first court challenge to a law being used by Republicans to ease federal regulation. In February, the Republican-controlled Congress used the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, to dismantle a rule that the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama finalized in August to limit hunting on federal lands in Alaska. The rule had exempted wolves and bears from Alaska’s plans to control predators, which included killing wolves and their pups in their dens and shooting bears from planes.  The CRA only requires simple majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate and the president’s signature to wipe newly minted regulations off the books.   In the federal court lawsuit, which likely has little chance of success, the Center for Biological Diversity said the CRA violated the U.S. Constitution because it barred regulators in the future from enacting “substantially similar” rules to the ones repealed.   “The Congressional Review Act throws the balance of power out of whack and opens the door for politicians in Congress to meddle in decisions that ought to be made by experts at federal agencies,” said Collette Adkins, a biologist and attorney at the center. “By law the Fish and Wildlife Service must protect biological diversity on Alaskan wildlife refuges. But the act makes it more difficult for agency officials to carry out their legal duty,” she said in a statement. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The CRA, drafted in 1996, has a structure and language that abide by what the U.S. Supreme Court said in the case INS v. Chadha, likely making it constitutional, said Karl Manheim, professor of law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. Since Feb. 1, Trump has signed 13 congressional resolutions repealing rules on the environment, education, gun control, corruption and family planning. Most advocacy groups that had tried to block the resolutions said this week they were not intending to file similar suits.  “Unfortunately I don’t think there’s an avenue for courts to overturn a CRA resolution,” said Alison Zieve who works in litigation for the liberal Public Citizen group.",politicsNews,"April 20, 2017 ",1

1968,"Mueller, New York attorney general cooperating on Manafort probe: Politico","Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team is working with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on its investigation into President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his financial transactions, Politico reported on Wednesday. Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, Politico reported Mueller’s team, which is investigating possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, and Schneiderman’s aides have shared evidence and talked frequently about a potential case in recent weeks. The cooperation “could potentially provide Mueller with additional leverage to get Manafort to cooperate in the larger investigation into Trump’s campaign, as Trump does not have pardon power over state crimes,” Politico reported. CNN reported on Tuesday that Mueller had issued subpoenas to an attorney who formerly represented Manafort and to a Manafort spokesman. Manafort’s Virginia apartment was raided by agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation last month. The longtime political consultant and lobbyist is being investigated for possible money laundering and has been targeted as someone who might testify against former colleagues, two people familiar with Mueller’s work have said. Politico said no decision had been made on whether to file charges, and quoted one of the sources as saying “Nothing is imminent.” Mueller’s team has been looking into Manafort’s lobbying work and financial transactions, including real estate deals in New York. Manafort, who headed Republican Trump’s campaign for several months in 2016, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Schneiderman, a Democrat, said in May that Trump’s firing of former FBI Director James Comey threatened the integrity of the agency. Trump has called Schneiderman a “lightweight.” Russia has denied any meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign and has condemned the investigation as political witch hunt.",politicsNews,"August 31, 2017 ",1

6388,Trump recommits to 'major border tax' on foreign-produced U.S. products,"President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday promised a “major border tax” on companies that shift jobs outside the United States, further pressuring American businesses days after Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) said heavy tariffs could force the company to shutter Mexican plants. Since the Nov. 8 election, Trump has taken to Twitter to call out by name a number of manufacturers with both planned and existing operations outside of the country. On Wednesday, he returned to the issue in his first news conference since the election. Trump, who will be sworn into office on Jan. 20, warned of a “very large border tax” on companies that shift production to foreign countries. “You want to move your plant, and you think, as an example, you’re going to build that plant in Mexico, and you’re going to make your air conditioners or your cars, or whatever you’re making, and you’re going to sell them through what will be a very, very strong border ... Not going to happen. You’re going to pay a very large border tax,” he warned.       U.S. automakers in particular have felt the brunt of Trump’s ire, as he has called for the industry to return to former manufacturing hubs in the American Midwest from Mexico, which accounts for a fifth of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in auto investment since 2010, according to the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research.     Trump thanked Fiat Chrysler and Ford Motor Co (F.N) for announcements in the past week of investments in Midwestern plants. He added that he hoped General Motors Co (GM.N), the No. 1 American automaker, would take similar steps to expand U.S. operations. On Monday, Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said, “It’s possible, if the economic terms imposed by the U.S. administration on anything that comes into the United States that, if they’re sufficiently large, that it would make the production of anything in Mexico uneconomical. “We would have to withdraw,” Marchionne said. “It is quite possible.” Trump also reiterated his criticism of Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jet program, saying it was “way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget.” After the news conference, Lockheed Martin said in a statement read on CNBC, “We understand President-elect Trump’s concerns about the F-35 program and we’ve given him our full commitment to drive down cost aggressively.” In its annual State of the American Business Address on Wednesday morning, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which traditionally has worked in concert with the Republican Party, urged Trump not to add to the “burdens” of exporters by erecting barriers to trade that could hamper economic growth.",politicsNews,"January 11, 2017 ",1

143,Factbox: Provisions of the U.S. Republicans' final tax bill,"Republicans in the U.S. Congress reached a deal on tax legislation on Wednesday, clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that, if approved, would be sent to President Donald Trump to sign into law. Formal language of the legislation, expected to add at least $1 trillion to the $20-trillion national debt over a decade, has not been released. The following are known provisions on which House of Representatives and Senate tax writers have agreed, based on conversations with aides and lawmakers: CORPORATE TAX RATE: Falls to 21 percent from 35 percent. The House and Senate bills, as well as Trump, had earlier proposed 20 percent. Going to 21 percent gave tax writers more federal revenue needed to allow the tax cut to take effect immediately. U.S. corporations have been seeking a large tax cut like this for many years.  PASS-THROUGH BUSINESSES: Creates a 20 percent business income deduction for owners of pass-through businesses, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships. The House had proposed a 25 percent tax rate; the Senate, a 23 percent deduction.  CORPORATE MINIMUM: Repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, which was set up to ensure profitable companies pay at least some federal tax. CLEAN ENERGY: Maintains production tax credit for wind energy and the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. The House had proposed repealing the electric vehicle credit and scaling back the wind energy credit. The Senate version did neither. INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX RATES: There will be seven brackets, and the top rate falls to 37 percent from 39.6 percent. The House had proposed maintaining the 39.6 percent top rate and condensing the current seven tax brackets to four. The Senate had proposed cutting the top rate to 38.5 percent and maintaining seven brackets. PERMANENCE: The expectation is that individual tax rates will snap back to current levels in less than 10 years, possibly after 2024. The individual tax rates in the House bill were to be permanent. The individual tax rates in the Senate bill were to expire after 2025. STATE AND LOCAL TAX (SALT): Both the House and Senate had proposed scaling back the popular individual deduction for state and local tax payments by limiting it to property-tax payments and capping that at $10,000. The compromise bill will keep that $10,000 cap, but allow for continued deduction of both state and local income tax payments, as well as property tax payments. MORTGAGE INTEREST: Caps the mortgage interest deduction for new mortgages at $750,000 in home loan value, down from the current $1 million. The House had proposed a $500,000 cap. The Senate bill left it at $1 million. ESTATE TAX: Roughly doubles the exemption from the federal estate tax on inherited assets to about $11 million per person, or about $22 million per couple, but leaves the estate tax in place, mirroring the Senate proposal. The House bill had proposed entirely repealing the estate tax over several years. OBAMACARE MANDATE: Repeals a federal fine imposed on Americans under Obamacare for not obtaining health insurance coverage. The House bill did not repeal the Obamacare individual mandate.  ANWR DRILLING: Allows oil drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The provision was sponsored by Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2017 ",1
7093,"Trump won with lowest minority vote in decades, fueling divisions","Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency with less support from black and Hispanic voters than any president in at least 40 years, a Reuters review of polling data shows, highlighting deep national divisions that have fueled incidents of racial and political confrontation. Trump was elected with 8 percent of the black vote, 28 percent of the Hispanic vote and 27 percent of the Asian-American vote, according to the Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll. Among black voters, his showing was comparable to the 9 percent captured by George W. Bush in 2000 and Ronald Reagan in 1984. But Bush and Reagan both did far better with Hispanic voters, capturing 35 percent and 34 percent, respectively, according to exit polling data compiled by the non-partisan Roper Center for Public Opinion Research.  And Trump’s performance among Asian-Americans was the worst of any winning presidential candidate since tracking of that demographic began in 1992. The racial polarization behind Trump’s victory has helped set the stage for tensions that have surfaced repeatedly since the election, in white supremacist victory celebrations, in anti-Trump protests and civil rights rallies, and in hundreds of racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic hate crimes documented by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks extremist movements. The SPLC reports there were 701 incidents of “hateful harassment and intimidation” between the day following the Nov. 8 election and Nov. 16, with a spike in such incidents in the immediate wake of the vote.     Signs point to an ongoing atmosphere of confrontation.     The Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a white separatist group that vilifies African-Americans, Jews and other minorities, plans an unusual Dec. 3 rally in North Carolina to celebrate Trump’s victory. Left-wing and anarchist groups have called for organized protests to disrupt the president-elect’s Jan. 20 inauguration. And a “Women’s March on Washington,” scheduled for the following day, is expected to draw hundreds of thousands to protest Trump’s presidency.     American politics became increasingly racialized through President Barack Obama’s two terms, “but there was an attempt across the board, across the parties, to keep those tensions under the surface,” says Jamila Michener, an assistant professor of government at Cornell University.  Trump’s anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric “brought those divisions to the fore; it activated people on the right, who felt empowered, and it activated people on the left, who saw it as a threat,” she added.     That dynamic was evident last week.     When Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended the Broadway musical “Hamilton” in New York on Friday, the multi-ethnic cast closed with a statement expressing fears of a Trump presidency. A far different view was on display the next day as a crowd of about 275 people cheered Trump’s election at a Washington conference of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist group with a strong anti-Semitic beliefs.      “We willed Donald Trump into office; we made this dream our reality,” NPI President Richard Spencer said. After outlining a vision of America as “a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity,” he closed with, “Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!” Though Trump’s election victory was driven by white voters, his performance even among that group was not as strong as some of his predecessors. Reagan and George H.W. Bush both won the presidency with higher shares of the white vote than the 55 percent that Trump achieved.      The historical voting patterns reflect decades of polarization in American politics, but the division surrounding Trump appears more profound, says Cas Mudde, an associate professor specializing in political extremism at the University of Georgia. These days, he adds, “people say they don’t want their children even to date someone from the other party.”     Indeed, voters’ opinions of those on the opposite side of the partisan divide have reached historic lows. Surveys by the Pew Research Center showed this year that majorities of both parties held “very unfavorable” views of the other party – a first since the center first measured such sentiment in 1992. And the lion’s share of those people believe the opposing party’s policies “are so misguided that they threaten the nation’s well-being,” the center found.     That level of division has spurred activists on both sides of the political divide to take their activism in a more confrontational direction.     In the wake of Trump’s victory, protesters on the left took to the streets by the thousands in cities across the country, in some cases causing property damage.  Much of the agitation was motivated by a belief that Trump’s administration will foster racism and push the courts and other political institutions to disenfranchise minority voters, says James Anderson, editor of ItsGoingDown.Org, an anarchist website that has promoted mass demonstrations against Trump’s presidency, including a call to disrupt his inauguration.     Many on the left have come to distrust government institutions, embracing a breed of activism aimed at directly confronting what they see as condemnable political forces, Anderson says. “The answer now is to organize, build power and autonomy and fight back.”     On the opposite end of the political spectrum, Trump’s election is bringing new hope for right-wing activists who felt abandoned by the major parties.      John Roberts, a top officer in the Ku Klux Klan affiliate planning the December rally to celebrate Trump’s election, says the group is committed to non-violent demonstrations, but he sees Trump’s election as likely to bring a new era of political conflict. And much of the strife, he says, will be centered around racial divisions.     “Once Trump officially takes office, there is going to be a boiling over at some point in time,” Roberts says. “Who knows when that’s going to be, but it’s not going to be pretty.”",politicsNews,"November 23, 2016 ",0

16768,Cambodian PM says main opposition party will be dissolved,"Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said on Monday it was  a fact  that the main opposition party would be dissolved as he spoke on the anniversary of the peace agreement that established multiparty democracy. More than 50 rights groups called on the countries that signed the Paris Peace Agreements in 1991 to reconvene urgently because of the threat to democracy in the Southeast Asian country. Hun Sen s government has asked the supreme court to dissolve the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) after its leader, Kem Sokha, was arrested on Sept. 3 and charged with treason. The court has yet to rule on whether the CNRP will be dissolved.  Because they didn t respect the Paris Peace Agreement, the political party will be dissolved in the future, this is a fact,  Hun Sen said at a ceremony marking the construction of a new bridge in Phnom Penh. Dissolving the party would eliminate the challenge to him prolonging more than 32 years in power in next year s election, but Western donors have criticized the move and called for the release of Kem Sokha. Hun Sen accused the United Nations of failing to bring peace despite organizing the first election in 1993 and said guerrilla fighting had only ended because of his own negotiations with leaders of the genocidal Khmer Rouge. Hun Sen s critics accuse him of trying to turn the country into a one-party state for the ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP). On Sunday, he said any elected officials who defect from the CNRP to his party would be allowed to keep their positions once the opposition party is dissolved. In a joint open letter on Monday, more than 50 rights groups called for the Paris Conference on Cambodia to be reconvened.  There is an urgent need for decisive action from the international community, to ensure that the democratic vision for Cambodia outlined in the Paris Peace Agreements is not completely forsaken,  said the letter. Hun Sen said calls for the original signatories to be reconvened were  out of date and impossible . He noted that one of the signatories, the Soviet Union, no longer exists. In the face of the Western criticism since the arrest of Kem Sokha, China has given verbal support to Hun Sen s government. China is by far the biggest donor to Cambodia and its biggest investor. China s influential Global Times tabloid said in an editorial on Sunday that Cambodia s  growth trend should not be interrupted by the country s rising political tension .

The nuclear deal was  a major achievement of European and international multilateral diplomacy , EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told a conference in Uzbekistan.  The European Union will make sure it will continue to be fully implemented by all, in all its parts,  she said. Trump on Oct. 13 dealt a blow to the pact by refusing to certify that Tehran was complying with the accord, under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. International inspectors said it was complying. The U.S. Congress has until mid-December to decide whether to reimpose sanctions lifted by the deal.  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also spoke on Friday at the United Nations-sponsored conference on Central Asian security and development in Samarkand.  By clinching the nuclear deal and fulfilling all our commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, we have in action proved our compliance with the principle of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament,  he said, without mentioning Trump directly. Mogherini said the EU s ties with ex-Soviet Central Asia were at an all-time high following moves by Uzbekistan s new government to open up the previously isolated nation. Mogherini, the first EU foreign policy chief to visit Uzbekistan in four years, met President Shavkat Mirziyoyev as well as foreign ministers of all five Central Asian nations. Mirziyoyev was elected president last December after the death of his authoritarian predecessor Islam Karimov, who was accused of systematic human rights abuses and whose relations with the West were poor. Seeking to modernize Uzbekistan s economy, Mirziyoyev has moved to mend those relations and announced an ambitious reform program at home. After a  very long and fruitful meeting  with Mirziyoyev, Mogherini said the reforms had the full support of Brussels. Mirziyoyev has also improved ties with neighboring Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan after years of bitter standoffs over matters such as borders and water use, winning further praise from Mogherini.

8787,Clinton vetting retired U.S. Navy Admiral Stavridis for VP: source,"Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign is vetting retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis as a potential vice presidential running mate, a source with knowledge of the process told Reuters on Tuesday. Stavridis is dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University near Boston and a former supreme allied commander of NATO.  “Admiral Stavridis is one of the finest military officers of his generation,” Michele Flournoy, a former under secretary at the U.S. Department of Defense, told Reuters in a statement. “He is a person of great ability and integrity, and an exceptional leader. He has the talents, experience, judgment and temperament to serve the American people at the highest levels of our government.” The Clinton campaign declined to comment on the vetting of Stavridis. Stavridis likewise declined to comment on the process. Flournoy, who formed a think tank after leaving the Defense Department and is advising the Clinton campaign on foreign policy, also did not comment on the vetting process. Flournoy is thought to be a probable Clinton pick for defense secretary if the presumptive Democratic nominee wins the White House on Nov. 8. Stavridis and Clinton worked closely together when he was at NATO and she led the U.S. State Department during Democratic President Barack Obama’s first term. Introducing Clinton at a 2013 awards dinner, Stavridis said, “She does the work of two, of 20, of 200 with her energy, with her enthusiasm and with her boundless determination to improve our world,” and praised her use of “smart power.” In a 2012 TED talk on global security, Stavridis began by saying: “My thesis for us today is, instead of building walls to create security, we need to build bridges.” Clinton has used similar rhetoric about the role of international diplomacy on the campaign trail. Stravidis was senior military assistant to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in the George W. Bush administration during the early years of the U.S. occupation of Iraq. That could provide presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump with a line of political attack.  Trump has throughout the campaign criticized Clinton for, as a U.S. senator, voting in favor of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Trump expressed early concerns about the operation’s cost. Another political millstone could be a 2012 Defense Department inspector general’s report that said Stavridis had failed to obtain prior authorization to use a government aircraft during an unofficial trip and submitted improper travel expenses. Stavridis was cleared of misconduct. Stavridis would bring military heft to Clinton’s presidential ticket. Trump is considering Michael Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, for the No. 2 spot. Flynn, a Democrat who is nonetheless fiercely critical of Obama’s foreign policy, would be an unconventional choice for Trump. The wealthy New York businessman is formally vetting former U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Indiana Governor Mike Pence.  Other potential vice presidential picks said to be on Clinton’s short list are U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tim Kaine of Virginia, according to news reports. Clinton campaigned alongside Warren in Ohio last month and is set to campaign with Kaine in his home state on Thursday. Her campaign has not confirmed that either is being formally vetted.",politicsNews,"July 12, 2016 ",0
4210,Trump FRANTICALLY Spins Illuminati-Like Global Conspiracy Theory To Explain His Death Spiral,"Since disgusting revelations came to light that show the Republicans  horse crap-covered, diseased nutsack of a nominee is actually a sexual predator, Trump has been frantically trying to cover his ass in every way imaginable. There is no line he will not cross, no level to which he will not sink, in order to turn the whole thing around in a pathetic attempt to come out smelling like roses. That includes pushing ever-wilder conspiracy theories about how the nefarious Hillary Clinton is behind all of this.Yes, Trump wants people to believe that this is all a worldwide smear campaign specifically intended to derail his candidacy. His asinine cease-and-desist letter to The New York Times revealed that (along with the true intent of the lawsuit threat), and so do the growing, nutty conspiracy theories he was touting in West Palm Beach today: The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media: the press. Let s be clear on one thing, the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They re a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or any other financial entity with a total political agenda and the agenda is not for you, it s for themselves.Their agenda is to elect crooked Hillary Clinton at any costs, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy. For them, it s a war. And for them, nothing at all is out of bounds. This is a struggle for the survival of our nation. Believe me. And this will be our last chance to save it. Oh, it s a war all right, but it s a war against the evil that pervades Trump and his loyal, minion-y followers. Nobody s destroyed Trump s life but Trump himself. When it comes to the women he s assaulted   he s out to destroy their lives, and the lives of members of the press, for daring to report the truth about him. He is so not a victim.Trump s followers are dead certain that this election will be stolen from them, and Trump is playing that like a master violinist. For Trump, it s simple: The election is stolen if he loses. The election is fair if he wins. End of story.His minionish cult of followers see it the exact same way.But wait! It gets better. He also drew connections between his assault victims coming forward, Wikileaks, and Hillary: These claims are all fabricated, they are pure fiction, and they are outright lies It s not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment and all together at the same time as Wikileaks releases documents exposing the massive international corruption of the Clinton machine. Coincidence or not, nothing changes the fact that he s a sexual predator who has no business being anywhere near a position of such power and responsibility as the presidency.As he continued to speak, his descent into madness became clearer: We ve seen this [corruption] first hand in the Wikileaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends, and her donors. The funny thing is that those emails reveal nothing of the sort. Time pointed out that a lot of things he said there are  invented.  As The Atlantic put it, they show a political candidate being political. Is that good? Not necessarily. However, they don t reveal anything nearly as horrific as what s come out about Trump recently.It s time for the cowardly GOP to actually come forward as a unified party and do something about this man. He s beyond help at this point.Featured image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images",News,"October 13, 2016",0
10831,Reaction to death of U.S. Justice Scalia,"Conservative U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has died, setting up a major political showdown between President Barack Obama and the Republican-controlled Senate over who will replace the jurist just months before a presidential election. Following is reaction to Scalia’s death. “For almost 30 years, Justice Antonin ‘Nino’ Scalia was a larger-than-life presence on the bench, a brilliant legal mind with an energetic style, an incisive wit and colorful opinions.” “I plan to fulfill my constitutional responsibilities to nominate a successor in due time. There will be plenty of time for me to do so and for the Senate to fulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote.” “These are responsibilities that I take seriously, as should everyone. They’re bigger than any one party. They are about our democracy. They’re about the institution to which Justice Scalia dedicated his professional life and making sure it continues to function as the beacon of justice that our founders envisioned.” “He was a towering figure and important judge on our nation’s highest court. He brought intellect, good judgment, and wit to the bench, and he will be missed by his colleagues and our country.” “He was an extraordinary individual and jurist, admired and treasured by his colleagues. His passing is a great loss to the Court and the country he so loyally served.” “The American people‎ should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.” “The president can and should send the Senate a nominee right away. With so many important issues pending before the Supreme Court, the Senate has a responsibility to fill vacancies as soon as possible. It would be unprecedented in recent history for the Supreme Court to go a year with a vacant seat. Failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of one of the Senate’s most essential Constitutional responsibilities.” REPUBLICAN SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN “Given the huge divide in the country, and the fact that this president, above all others, has made no bones about his goal to use the courts to circumvent Congress and push through his own agenda, it only makes sense that we defer to the American people who will elect a new president to select the next Supreme Court justice.” SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY, RANKING DEMOCRAT ON SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE “The Supreme Court of the United States is too important to our democracy for it to be understaffed for partisan reasons. It is only February. The president and the Senate should get to work without delay to nominate, consider and confirm the next justice to serve on the Supreme Court.” “Unless (Obama) can find a consensus choice, the next president will pick the replacement for Justice Scalia ... If we lose the election, Hillary Clinton is going to pick somebody that I wouldn’t pick. I’m telling every conservative now, don’t expect to lose the election and still get your way.” “I think it is too late to nominate someone now. “He (Obama) has every right to nominate but it will be up to the Senate to evaluate that nomination ... and decide whether to move forward with it.” “My hope is that the president will promptly nominate someone with strong intellect and integrity who can win bipartisan support. I will work vigorously as a member of the Judiciary Committee to achieve confirmation.” “The Republicans in the Senate and on the campaign trail who are calling for Justice Scalia’s seat to remain vacant dishonor our Constitution. The Senate has a constitutional responsibility here that it cannot abdicate for partisan political reasons.” “While I differed with Justice Scalia’s views and jurisprudence, he was a brilliant, colorful and outspoken member of the Supreme Court.” “He was a justice who did not believe in legislating from the bench and he is a person whom I held in the highest regard and will always greatly respect his intelligence and conviction to uphold the constitution of our country.” “As liberals and conservatives alike would agree, through his powerful and persuasive opinions, Justice Scalia fundamentally changed how courts interpret the Constitution and statutes, returning the focus to the original meaning of the text after decades of judicial activism.” “One of the greatest honors in my life was to attend oral arguments during Town of Greece v. Galloway and see Justice Scalia eloquently defend religious freedom.” “His logic and wit were unparalleled, and his decisions were models of clarity and good sense. I often said he was my favorite justice because he took the Constitution, and the responsibility of judges to interpret it correctly, with the utmost seriousness.” OHIO GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE “His death is a serious loss to our nation and the court. He was an essential, principled force for conservative thought and is a model for others to follow.”  “It is imperative that the Senate not allow President Obama to diminish his legacy by trying to nominate an individual who would carry on his wishes to subvert the will of the people.” “I expect they will nominate a replacement and the Senate will refuse to take it up. From a policy standpoint, a lot of knotty decisions that might have been 5-4 will now be tied and, assuming the Senate won’t act, the lower court rulings will stand. That means on immigration, for example, the Fifth Circuit ruling invalidating the president’s order may prevail.”",politicsNews,"February 14, 2016 ",1
19109,Qatar Says Trump wants to fix Gulf crisis with dialogue,"Qatar s foreign minister said on Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump was stepping up efforts for a diplomatic solution to the crisis in the Gulf. Trump initially took a hard line against Qatar, calling it a  high level  sponsor of terrorism after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt shook the region by cutting political and trade ties with the small state in June. The action suspended air and shipping routes with the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, which is home to the region s biggest U.S. military base. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told reporters in Paris that he had seen a  greater desire  from Trump to fix the stand-off through discussion.   He has stated very clearly that he doesn t want to see conflict among friends. So there is a determination by the U.S. to solve this by dialogue.  There was no immediate comment from the White House. In Trump s initial comments in June, he suggested he had helped plan the Qatar action with Arab leaders, though last week he said he expected the dispute to be solved quickly. The nations say Doha supports regional foe Iran and Islamists, charges Qatar s leaders deny.  Al-Thani said Qatar was doing well economically despite the sanctions, but said the Arab action was actually driving Qatar closer to Tehran, something Doha has acknowledged in the past.  They said Qatar was now closer to Iran. By their measures they are pushing Qatar to Iran. They are giving Iran, or any regional force, Qatar like a gift,  he said.  Is that their objective, to push one country, a GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) member state toward Iran? This is not a wise objective,  he added. Al-Thani said Qatar s position over Syria had not changed. Both Qatar and Saudi Arabia have backed Syrian rebels, despite their differences.  After eight months, after the militarization of the (Syrian) revolution, this is when Qatar decided to take a side. We decided to stand with the people,  said al-Thani.  Our position - will it be changed because blockading nations have a dispute with us? That would mean our principles that we are fighting for our worthless. Our position and the values which we have stuck to from the beginning have remained the same. War criminals need to be held accountable,  he added.",worldnews,"September 25, 2017 ",1
14720,"Head of Afghan election body sacked, raising doubts over 2018 ballots","Afghan President Ashraf Ghani sacked the chairman of the country s Independent Election Commission on Wednesday, raising doubts over whether parliamentary and council ballots scheduled for next year will take place as planned. Najibullah Ahmadzai, head of the body charged with organizing the elections, had faced growing pressure following repeated delays to preparations for them and had lost the support of both Ghani and disillusioned foreign donors. The 2018 votes are seen as dry runs for a presidential election in 2019 and a key test of the progress made by Afghanistan s Western-backed government towards establishing durable democratic institutions. Following a contentious presidential election in 2014, marred by allegations of massive voter fraud on both sides, international donor countries have laid heavy emphasis on the need for successful elections next year. But planning has been beset by a mix of technical and political problems that have made the officially scheduled date of July 2018 increasingly unrealistic. Five members of the seven-member IEC wrote to Ghani this week accusing Ahmadzai of was incompetence. Ambitious plans for a biometric voter registration system had to be abandoned and squabbling between members of parliament and Ghani s fragile National Unity Government over issues including who sits on the election commission have caused months of delay. The problems underline the fragility of the political institutions created in Afghanistan since a U.S.-led campaign brought down the Taliban in 2001. The bitter 2014 presidential election produced no agreed winner and led to a U.S.-brokered deal which saw former rivals Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah forced into an uneasy coalition that has struggled to win popular support. District council elections have never been held, despite being mandated in the 2004 constitution, while the current parliament s term was supposed to end in June 2015 but has been extended due to the difficulty of holding new elections. Last month, officials from international partners including the United Nations told the Afghan government that even under the most favorable conditions, the earliest date on which an election could feasibly be held was Oct. 2018.  Many Western diplomats believe even that date is impossible. If not ready by October, Afghanistan s mountainous terrain, bad roads and lack of security mean that registering voters and setting up balloting stations across the country are likely to face severe delays over the winter months, potentially pushing the date into the following year.",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",0

1175,Fox News Confuses Julius Caesar Depiction For Trump And Gets PISSED about Shakespeare,"Fox News loves to point the finger at  Snowflakes  and anybody they think should buck-up and not complain about the way of the world. Ironically, they also are the first to freak-out over any type of artistic expression that they think puts the President in an unflattering light. A disgusting New York City play depicting the president brutally assassinated,  is how Fox and Friends began a news segment about an NYC Shakespeare in the Park play they found to be offensive. Fox apparently succeeded at stoking conservative outrage because even Donald Trump Jr. seems to have his panties in a bunch over the play.I wonder how much of this ""art"" is funded by taxpayers? Serious question, when does ""art"" become political speech & does that change things? https://t.co/JfOmLLBJCn  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 11, 2017So what is this outrageous performance? A play called The Tragedy of Julius Caesar, which was written by William Shakespeare all the way back in 1599   way before The Donald got his greasy paws on the White House.Most people are familiar with Julius Caesar from high school English class. The plot highlights the agony of Brutus, Caesar s pal who ends up conspiring to murder him. This particular version seems to be confusing Fox and Friends because of its anachronistic interpretation   the players are dressed in the clothes of today.According to Fox, they are sure this is a depiction of a Trump assassination because the actor looks very similar to the tall, blond businessman elected president in 2016. It s definitely a unique interpretation of the play, but modern updates of Shakespearean plays are very common   think 90 s Romeo and Juliet.On top of that, the play doesn t depict Caesar s assassination as a positive event nor the assassins as heroes.It s pretty snowflakey for Fox to be this pissed about a Shakespeare play.

20688,Hurricane Irma worsens Latin America's fuel supply crunch,"Monster Hurricane Irma has shut down oil terminals across the northern Caribbean, worsening a fuel supply crunch in Latin America which is struggling to meet demand since Hurricane Harvey disrupted shipments from the U.S. Gulf Coast last month. Latin America had been scrambling for almost two weeks to find oil cargoes because of Harvey, which caused massive flooding in Texas and Louisiana, shutting down ports, refineries and production platforms. Irma, which is being followed by two hurricanes in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, was affecting Caribbean refineries, terminals and storage facilities. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Irma is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean and one of the five most forceful storms to hit the Atlantic basin in 82 years. The Caribbean has the capacity to store more than 100 million barrels, which is crucial for those nations because of limited ability to refine crude, and also as supply for South American nations including Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia.  Several oil trading firms had moved a portion of their U.S. fuel inventories to the Caribbean ahead of Harvey so they could keep selling cargoes to Latin America, traders from two companies told Reuters.  Those barrels are now locked in terminals in St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as Irma, a Category 5 storm with winds of 185 mph (295 kph), was expected to hammer the region for several more days as it moves west-northwest.   Irma is arriving at a bad moment. Not all oil storage facilities in the Caribbean have closed, but vessel traffic is difficult in the middle of the storm. It will get worse before getting any better,  said a trader from an oil firm that rents tanks in St. Croix. Buckeye Partners LP (BPL.N), the largest owner of oil storage facilities in the Caribbean with 41.1 million barrels of capacity, shut its Puerto Rico terminal on Wednesday. It also plans to close BORCO, its largest terminal in the Bahamas that can store up to 26.2 million barrels, by the end of the day on Thursday, a source familiar with terminal operations said. Also in the Bahamas, Statoil s (STL.OL) South Riding Point terminal was open on Thursday, the company said. But traders added that plans to halt marine operations would likely start later on Thursday.  NuStar Energy LP (NS.N), which on Tuesday closed its 13-million-barrel Statia terminal on the small island of St. Eustatius, said several tanks and other equipment were damaged in the hurricane, so no restart date has been set. Firms using tanks in closed terminals in St. Eustatius, St. Croix, Bahamas and Puerto Rico include traders Vitol, Glencore (GLEN.L), Novum Energy and Freepoint Commodities, and oil firms PDVSA from Venezuela, China s Sinopec (600028.SS), Russia s Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and Lukoil (LKOH.MM), U.S. Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), according to the sources and Reuters vessel data. As traders worry about Irma s impact on inventories, others see longer-term potential consequences from this or other storms, as both Jose, now in the Atlantic Ocean, and Katia, off Mexico s coast, continued moving on Thursday after strengthening to hurricanes.  If a hurricane with Irma s intensity strikes a terminal tank farm, the force of the storm at the eye wall will have destructive impact on the storage tanks, which are typically not designed to withstand those forces,  said Ernie Barsamian, chief executive officer of the Tank Tiger, a terminal storage clearinghouse. Mexican state-run oil company Pemex said on Thursday that its facilities have not been hit so far, but it keeps monitoring Katia s path to decide if further action was needed. Fuel importers such as Mexico and Brazil have secured supplies in recent days from the U.S. East Coast, Europe and the Caribbean, according to traders, regulators and oil firms. But those options are running short amid growing regional demand and limited offers from Texas refiners as ports have been slow to reopen for large vessels. The only option that traders see for desperate buyers in the coming days is to divert fuel cargoes from countries such as Brazil, which bought diesel in excess, or Venezuela, which cannot pay for all the fuel floating near its ports because of the country s fiscal problems. At least three fuel cargoes have been diverted from Venezuela since last week, according to Reuters data. All of them have changed their destinations to Panama, likely to pass the Canal before discharging in South America.   Companies from Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru and Costa Rica are seeking spot cargoes of diesel, gasoline, aviation gasoline, asphalt and components on the open market, but few providers are willing to participate, traders said.  I cannot use my inventories in the Caribbean at this moment to supply third parties,  one trader said. Dominican Republic refining firm Refidomsa, which declared force majeure last week on deliveries, has been rationing fuel from its 34,000-barrel-per-day Haina refinery, giving it enough inventory for 20 days.  Most Caribbean refineries are dependent on U.S. light oil since large regional crude producers such as Mexico and Venezuela have cut exports to some neighbors.",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",1
20252,Senate leader opposes 'lecturing' Myanmar leader Suu Kyi,"U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday he would not support a resolution targeting Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi over the treatment of the country s Rohingya Muslims, and said Washington should not be  lecturing  her.   I don t favor a resolution going after her,  McConnell, who has been engaged with issues related to Myanmar, also known as Burma, for years.  I think she s the greatest hope that we have to move Burma from where it has been, a military dictatorship, to where I hope it s going.  Senators John McCain, a Republican, and Richard Durbin, a Democrat, introduced a resolution last week condemning the violence and urging Suu Kyi to act. But McConnell said he did not support the resolution.  My personal view is America kind of singling her out, and lecturing her when she s in a very challenging position is not helpful. So ... I don t intend to be a part of that,  he said at a weekly news conference by the Senate s Republican leaders. McConnell did not respond to a question about whether there was any consideration of reconsidering Democratic former President Barack Obama s lifting of sanctions on Myanmar. International pressure has been mounting on Myanmar to end violence that has sent about 370,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh. The Trump administration has called for protection of civilians, and Bangladesh has urged safe zones so refugees can return home. While Washington has been a staunch supporter of Myanmar s transition from decades of harsh military rule being led by Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate has been criticized as doing too little to stop the violence. In addition to co-sponsoring the resolution, McCain, the influential chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Tuesday he would seek to remove U.S. military cooperation with Myanmar from a sweeping defense policy bill now making its way through Congress. The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, had called for expanded military cooperation.  While I had hoped the NDAA could contribute to positive reform in Burma, I can no longer support expanding military-to-military cooperation given the worsening humanitarian crisis and human rights crackdown against the Rohingya people,  McCain said in a statement.",worldnews,"September 12, 2017 ",0

10416,U.S. hedge fund managers pour money into 2016 race and Trump is a factor,"Major U.S. hedge fund managers are on pace this year to more than double the amount they gave in the 2012 election campaign, with independent fundraising groups backing Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Ted Cruz receiving the most so far. About $47 million has been lavished on presidential candidates and lawmakers and the political action committees that support them by two dozen of the industry's top managers in the first 13 months of this election season, according to a Reuters review of Federal Election Commission filings. (For a list of the top givers see tmsnrt.rs/1nlPYZv) Most of the hedge fund support going to Cruz and Clinton has come from a handful of people out of the two dozen managers studied. Robert Mercer, co-chief executive of Renaissance Technologies, for example, has given $11 million to Keep the Promise I, a Super PAC that supports Cruz. Mercer is an enigmatic computer programmer who is a powerful financial force in conservative politics. Cruz wants to abolish the tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service, slash income and payroll taxes and impose a new “business transfer tax.” Cruz’s wife, Heidi Cruz, is a Goldman Sachs executive in Houston. Clinton’s main benefactor is billionaire George Soros, a long-time patron of Democratic and humanitarian causes and chairman of Soros Fund Management. Soros alone is responsible for $7.3 million of the $11.7 million that has gone to Super PACs and other committees supporting Clinton. The hedge fund managers’ spokespersons either declined to comment or did not respond to queries from Reuters. But Whitney Tilson, a hedge fund manager who runs Kase Capital, said one reason fellow managers are spending more this election is Donald Trump, the front-runner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. “There are some pretty heated emotions about Donald Trump,” said Tilson, who plans to support the Democratic Party nominee. Trump, who says he is self-funding his campaign, supports closing a loophole that lets some hedge fund managers pay less than the usual income tax rate on performance fees they get known as “carried interest.” Clinton supports this, too. The Managed Funds Association, an industry lobbying group, declined to comment on policy aims under the next president. There are other worries, too, about a Trump presidency.After months of campaigning and debates, Trump’s economic and financial policy positions are still sketchy or unknown. A Trump presidency could bring “tremendous uncertainty and instability,” said Gregory Wawro, a political science professor at Columbia University.  Wawro speculated that Trump’s popularity with blue-collar and middle-class voters could prompt the Republican Party to reassess an approach to taxes and economic issues that has favored top earners and major corporations in recent years.  The surge of hedge fund donations has had little effect on the Republican race so far. Cruz is running well behind Trump while U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who is seen by establishment Republicans as their best hope to stop Trump winning the nomination, is a distant third. Conservative Solutions, a Super PAC that backs Rubio, received $2.5 million from Paul Singer, the long-time Republican fundraiser who runs Elliott Management, and another $2.6 million in contributions from hedge fund manager Kenneth Griffin of Citadel Investment Group. Two other Republican candidates with major hedge fund backing, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, have dropped out of the race. Christie’s Super PAC, America Leads, received about $3 million from Steve Cohen of Point72 Asset Management, while Right to Rise, a PAC that supports Bush, drew $450,000 in donations from managers including Citadel’s Griffin, David Tepper of Appaloosa Management and Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management. In the Democratic race, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has eschewed donations from Wall Street. He has racked up a string of wins in early state nominating contests with attacks on Wall Street and calls for a more equitable distribution of the country’s wealth. Overall, hedge fund contributions to 2016 presidential candidates and lawmakers and the PACs supporting them favored Republicans over Democrats by about 3 to 2.

7022,Trump vows to end U.S.-Cuba 'deal' unless Havana makes better one,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday he would end the United States’ “deal” with Cuba unless a better one was made, reflecting his campaign pledge to reverse President Barack Obama’s moves to open relations with the Cold War adversary. “If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal,” Trump said in a Twitter post.  Some Cubans are worried Trump will shut down the U.S.-Cuban trade and travel ties that have begun to emerge in the past two years since Obama’s historic decision to end decades of Cold War hostility and open an embassy in Havana. U.S. airlines launched the first regular flights to Havana in more than five decades on Monday. Trump’s tweeted as Cubans commemorated Fidel Castro, the guerrilla leader who led a revolution in 1959 and ruled the Caribbean island for half a century. Castro died on Friday. During Trump’s campaign for the White House he had said he thought restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba was fine but that Obama should have cut a better deal. Newsweek reported that one of his companies had attempted to do business in the Communist-ruled island. Later in the campaign, he toughened his rhetoric, seeking to reassure Cuban-American voters in Florida that he opposed Castro and his brother, Raul, to whom he turned over power in 2008. On Saturday, Trump said in a statement that his administration would “do all it can” once he takes office on Jan. 20 to boost freedom and prosperity for Cubans after Castro’s death. Cuba always has fiercely resisted what it sees as U.S. involvement in its politics. The government has stayed mostly quiet on Trump, waiting to see whether he converts his rhetoric into policy change. The makeup of Trump’s transition team has suggested he could with the inclusion of Mauricio Claver-Carone, a leading advocate for maintaining a tough economic embargo, and Robert Blau, a hard-line anti-communist who was openly hostile toward the Castro government while posted as a diplomat in Havana during the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. Many Cubans are defiant, however, saying their main problem was the U.S. economic embargo. “We have lived for 50 years with the blockade so we are going to continue living the same way with or without Trump,” Teresa Almentero, 52, a cigar roller, said after paying tribute to Castro in Revolution Square. “He doesn’t scare me, nor does he scare any Cuban.”",politicsNews,"November 28, 2016 ",1

5304,This Scary Message From Obama Is Why EVERYONE Needs To Vote For Hillary (VIDEO),"When Donald Trump first announced that he was running for the White House, no one took him seriously. We all laughed and joked about it, thinking it might be entertaining to watch his train wreck of a campaign for a few months before the other candidates left him in the dust. We watched him make racist, misogynistic, hateful remarks and didn t think he would last, but here we are  he managed to become the Republican nominee. Recognizing that we need to do something about that, President Barack Obama has a message for Americans.In an interview with TODAY s Savannah Guthrie, Obama doubled down on the dangers of Trump getting into the White House. Several months ago, it seemed that Obama was brushing off Trump s campaign just like the rest of us, but that has all changed as we near the general election. When asked if Trump could win, Obama didn t sugarcoat it for Americans when he said,  anything is possible Obama s comments didn t come without a few jabs at The Donald, as the President hammered the business mogul for being a pathological liar. Obama said, He is someone that likes attention, he surprised himself that he got this far. As far as the threat of living under a President Trump, Obama said, I ve seen all kinds of crazy stuff happen  but overall stressed that  America is resilient. But just because America might survive 4-8 years of Donald Trump does not mean that we should give him the chance to undo all of our progress and threaten our country s future. Obama stressed the importance of electing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November, and urged all Democratic voters to take this election very seriously. Obama said: So, my advice to Democrats   and I don t have to give this advice to Hillary Clinton, because she already knows it   is you stay worried until all those those votes are cast and counted because you know, one of the dangers in an election like this is that people don t take the challenge seriously. They stay home. And we end up getting the unexpected. You can watch Obama s interview below:Obama s comments to voters reflect the tone of the Democratic National Convention this week, as voters are urged to stay hungry and keep working hard right up to November. For the voters that are upset that Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders was not selected as the nominee, Obama s message is especially for them. We can t afford to be upset. We can t afford to be so upset that we sit this election out. The stakes are too high. We cannot give our country to a sociopath and bigot like Donald Trump because he will destroy it. Regardless of who you voted for in the primaries, we need to move on and do everything to prevent Trump from getting into the White House.

8094,Japan PM stresses importance of TPP trade pact in Clinton meeting,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Monday and stressed it was important for the United States to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal that she opposes, Japanese officials said. Abe and Clinton met for about 15 minutes at Abe’s hotel in New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, the officials said. The meeting was held at Clinton’s request, they said. The two stressed the importance of strengthening the U.S.-Japan security relationship and both outlined their known positions on the 12-nation TPP, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The pact has been agreed, but not ratified by the United States or Japan. Clinton, the Democratic candidate in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, has opposed the deal, which is unpopular with labor unions and environmental groups, although she championed it while serving as secretary of state. In a speech to U.S. business leaders in New York on Monday, Abe described TPP as a “pillar” of the U.S. rebalance of policy emphasis to Asia, which comes in response to China’s rise. “Through the TPP, the U.S. can make clear its commitment to playing a leadership role in the growing Asia-Pacific,” he said. “Japan and the U.S. must each obtain domestic approval of the TPP as soon as possible,” Abe said. “Success or failure will sway the direction of the global free trade system, and the strategic environment in the Asia-Pacific.” Abe said he would pursue TPP approval at an upcoming session of Japan’s parliament. “Japan will spare no effort, and we count on the U.S. to do the same,” he said. On Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama engaged Ohio Governor John Kasich, a high-profile political foe, to help press Republicans to approve the TPP before he leaves office in four months. The unusual move is a sign of how the White House intends to make a final full-court push to convince Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress to approve the deal in a “lame duck” session after the election. The TPP has been pilloried by both Republican and Democratic candidates. Republicans traditionally have backed free trade deals, but their presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has blamed them for U.S. job losses and threatened to tear them up should he win. Abe had no meeting with Trump, who has accused Tokyo of not  pulling its weight in its security alliance with Washington. The Japanese officials said Trump had not requested a meeting.",politicsNews,"September 20, 2016 ",1
5879,Koch network launches effort to kill Republican border tax plan,"Billionaire industrialist Charles Koch is launching a campaign to sink a border tax under consideration by Republican leaders in Congress, a move that could complicate the lawmakers’ efforts to find a way to pay for President Donald Trump’s proposed wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group founded by Charles Koch and his brother David, plans to use its network of wealthy political donors and activists to kill the proposal, which aims to raise $1.2 trillion over 10 years on goods coming into the United States, according to officials from the group, which gathered this weekend for a conference. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan is pushing the tax as part of a broader overhaul of the U.S. tax code. The White House has given mixed signals on whether Trump supports the approach, but proponents say revenue collected from the border tax could finance Trump’s drive to build a wall along the southwestern U.S. border. Proponents also say it would discourage U.S. manufacturers from moving abroad. On Thursday, AFP sent a letter expressing its opposition to the border tax to a House panel in charge of writing tax legislation. AFP Chief Executive Officer Luke Hilgemann, in an interview, called the measure “a massive tax increase” on U.S. consumers, who would pay more for foreign goods. He urged Ryan to “go back to the drawing board.” AFP and its offshoot organizations have become a powerful force in U.S. politics, bolstering candidates and issues on federal and state levels. Besides defying Republican leaders on the border tax, the Koch-led organization on Sunday challenged Trump on a policy he implemented on Friday to stop the movement of people from countries with large Muslim populations from traveling to the United States. “The travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive,” said an official of the Koch network. Koch refused to endorse Trump during his presidential campaign, differing with the candidate over his positions on immigration and trade policy, and his practice of singling out companies for possible retribution if they move jobs abroad. Nevertheless, Hilgemann said AFP had a “developing relationship” with the Trump White House, which he said had reached out to his organization to discuss some policy matters. At the same time, former AFP officials have landed high-level jobs in the Trump administration, giving the group a conduit for airing its policy wishes. Looking toward the 2018 congressional and gubernatorial elections, AFP officials said they planned to boost the network’s spending on policy and political activities to between $300 million and $400 million, up from an estimated $250 million for the 2016 campaigns. Hilgemann also said AFP was laying plans to mobilize activists to help win Senate confirmation of Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court nominee. The White House said Trump was planning this week to announce his pick to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia.",politicsNews,"January 30, 2017 ",1
2169,Texas 'bathroom bill' dies in special legislative session,"Texas measures criticized as being discriminatory for limiting transgender people’s access to bathrooms in schools and public buildings died on Tuesday, as the House adjourned and ended its special legislative session. Business leaders and civil rights groups had battled to defeat the bills, saying they advanced bigotry, would tarnish the state’s image and damage its economy. The measures were blocked by moderate House Republicans.  Adoption by Texas, the most populous Republican-dominated state, could have fed momentum in other socially conservative states on the issue, a flashpoint in the U.S. culture wars. “Finally, Texans can breathe a temporary sigh of relief,” said JoDee Winterhof, an official of the Human Rights Campaign that lobbied against the bills. “Texans don’t want harmful, anti-transgender legislation,” Winterhof, the campaign’s senior vice president for policy and political affairs, said in a statement. Momentum for so-called bathroom bills stalled this year when  North Carolina partially repealed a similar law in March. The original law prompted boycotts by athletic bodies and businesses that are estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Texas could have lost about $5.6 billion through 2026 if it had enacted such a measure, said the Texas Association of Business, the state’s leading employer grouping. The House wound up its duties without taking action on any of the bills and adjourned “sine die,” a day ahead of the official end of the 30-day special session. House Speaker Joe Straus, a pro-business Republican who controls the agenda in the chamber, said the issue was not a priority. Straus’ position was reinforced by a well-financed campaign by major corporations, including Texas-based energy companies Halliburton and ExxonMobil Global Services, which have said the bills would make it hard for them to recruit top talent. The measure that advanced the farthest was Senate Bill 3, which passed easily on a party-line vote in the Republican-controlled Senate and then died in the House. It would have required people to use restrooms, showers and locker rooms in public schools and other state and local government facilities that match the sex on their birth certificate, as opposed to their gender identity. Supporters, including Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a staunch social conservative, say the proposed curbs promote public safety and protect vulnerable women and children.",politicsNews,"August 16, 2017 ",1

6656,Paul Ryan Wants To Make This Healthcare Nightmare A Reality Again (VIDEO),"On Wednesday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called for an end to protections found in the Affordable Care Act that prevent insurance companies from denying people coverage based on pre-existing conditions.Reuters reports that Ryan told students at Georgetown University that he is in favor of scrapping the protections found in the Affordable Care Act that prevent insurers from charging higher rates for sick people in favor of creating subsidized  risk pools  on a state level. Less than 10 percent of people under 65 are what we call people with pre-existing conditions, who are really kind of uninsurable,  Ryan said.  Let s fund risk pools at the state level to subsidize their coverage so that they can get affordable coverage,  he said.  You dramatically lower the price for everybody else. You make health insurance so much more affordable, so much more competitive and open up competition. Less than 10 percent of people under 65  is a deceptive way to describe approximately 26 million people. A report released in 2011 from the Department of Health and Human Services found that half of the U.S. population has some sort of preexisting condition. That study includes those who are aged 65-years or older. The term  preexisting condition  is broad and different studies can provide wildly different figures on the number of people who have a preexisting condition, depending on how the term is defined in the study.Support for the Affordable Healthcare Act as a whole has run mostly along partisan lines. Republicans strongly are in favor of scrapping President Obama s healthcare reforms altogether. However, out of all of the individual provisions found in the Affordable Care Act, protections for people with preexisting conditions have consistently received support from people in the U.S. across the political spectrum. A survey conducted in 2012, just before that year s presidential election, found that 82% of respondents supported provisions set in place to prevent insurance companies from denying people coverage based on preexisting conditions.That makes Ryan s choice to vocally oppose those protections a major political gamble. Ryan, along with the rest of the Republican Party has failed to offer any solid alternatives to the Affordable Care Act during their now nearly decade-long opposition to healthcare reform package. Republicans are stuck between a rock and a hard place when trying to define an alternative to the Affordable Care Act. With the exception of the individual mandate, polls show that people tend to support key aspects of the healthcare act than they do when asked if they support the act in its entirety.You can watch Ryan s speech in full below.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images)",News,"April 28, 2016",0
4485,EU official says no sign Trump plans to ease Russia sanctions,"A senior European Union official said on Tuesday he had seen no  sign that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration planned to lift sanctions on Russia over its activities in Ukraine, and warned that unilateral American sanctions on Russia could destabilize some European energy markets. “We have had no such indication,” David O’Sullivan, the head of the EU mission to the United States, told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on how the United States and EU could work together to push back against Russian aggression. “I think there is still remarkable unity of purpose between the United States and the European Union with regard to those issues,” O’Sullivan said. Allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian actors were behind the hacking of senior Democratic Party operatives and spreading disinformation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election have lingered over Trump’s tenure. Democrats charge the Russians wanted to tilt the election toward the Republican, who worried lawmakers from both parties during his campaign by calling for warmer relations with Russia. Trump has dismissed that claim, and Russia denies the allegations. During the hearing, Corker questioned the wisdom of legislation to impose more sanctions on Russia over its aggressive actions in Ukraine and Syria. Senator Ben Cardin, the foreign relations committee’s top Democrat, drafted such a bill earlier this year. It is sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans. Corker asked O’Sullivan whether it would be preferable for the United States to act unilaterally or work with the European Union on such sanctions. O’Sullivan said “close coordination” would be preferable. “We have moved in lockstep throughout this process and I think that has not only ensured of the right political response, but also the effectiveness of the sanctions,” O’Sullivan said. Some of the ideas that have been discussed could have a serious impact on the European energy sector, he said. “Many of our member states are heavily dependent upon imports from Russia and it would be very important not to destabilize that situation,” O’Sullivan said.  Cardin said some sanctions Europe has imposed on Russia are stronger those by the United States. “There may be some interest for us to try to pattern some of our sanctions on what Europe has already imposed on Russia,” he said.",politicsNews,"April 4, 2017 ",1

Most notably, a short interview in a major Hollywood designer documentary called The Big Fix in 2012, discussing the BP oil spill at Deep Water Horizon.Mateen at the 36 minute mark, played the part of a concerned security guard, taking on a scripted activist-type character revealing that  everybody is out to get paid,  and that  they want more disaster to happen, cuz that s where there money making is  even though he was currently working for the world s largest security contractor overseeing the apparent environmental crisis.Indeed, Mateen was also featured in another documentary called Love City Jalalabad (2013), a feature supposedly depicting progressive Afghani youth and a quest for social change, created by the abstract artist/filmmaker George Gittoes, whose works delve into the holographic and hyperreal, as he was also said to be a former collaborator with the famed screen print legend Andy Warhol and holographic pioneer physicist Zoltan Hegedus (hat-tip 21WIRE contributor Randy Johnson).Gittoes has a background in politically charged propaganda films, with him  [Creating a] series of works including The Hotel Kennedy Suite and The Kent State Suite responding to events in the United States, including anti-Vietnam War protests and the Kent State shootings at Kent State University, Ohio,  in 1970.Additionally, during a time of great upheaval, Gittoes  [traveled] to Bosnia (April May) on a privately sponsored trip to document United Nations- monitored elections. Produces series of paintings based on the people of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and documents the effects of the 1992 96 Bosnian War for independence, the longest siege of a city in the history of modern warfare. Gittoes then traveled to Iraq four times between March 2003 and May 2004, making a trilogy of films based on The War On Terror.Comparatively, in an article written by Jay Dyer of Jay s Analysis we re reminded of other connections with intelligence agencies and Hollywood. Here s a passage where Dyer observes historical links between the CIA and Hollywood, through the former CIA general counsel: Author John Rizzo has recently published a book titled Company Man: Thirty Years of Controversy and Crisis in the CIA, which is an amazing admission of this scandalous affair between intelligence and the film industry.  The L.A. Times comments: The CIA has long had a special relationship with the entertainment industry, devoting considerable attention to fostering relationships with Hollywood movers and shakers studio executives, producers, directors, big-name actors,  John Rizzo, the former acting CIA general counsel, wrote in his new book,  Company Man: Thirty Years of Crisis and Controversy in the CIA.The CIA also recruits actors to give more visibility to propaganda projects abroad, such as a documentary secretly produced by the agency, Rizzo said. And the agency sometimes takes advantage of the door-opening cachet that movie stars and other American celebrities enjoy. A star who met a world leader, for example, might be asked for details about that meeting.The CIA has officials assigned full-time to the care and feeding of Hollywood assets, Rizzo wrote.  Other former CIA officials added that some of those operatives work in the Los Angeles office of an agency department called the National Resources Division, which recruits people in the U.S. to help America spy abroad. Through the connections above, were also reminded of the alleged Orlando shooter s father, Seddique Mateen, who is closely tied to some of the most powerful leaders and agencies in Washington DC. Here s a passage from a recent 21WIRE report discussing a deeper intelligence connection with the Mateen family: Omar Mateen, worked as a contractor for the US Department of Homeland Security, then we learned that the elder Mateen is also standing to run for President of Afghanistan and is allied with the Taliban leadership   an absolutely ideal profile for a Washington-managed, CIA controlled-opposition political candidate.

The media script seems already written before the killer is even named.Crisis Actors    Agents of Change Here Peekay Truth shows a video depicting strange elements surrounding the Orlando shooting The  dancing actor  clip depicted above is reminiscent of the October drill said to have taken place during the Canadian Parliament shooting in 2014, where many wondered why police and security services were seen laughing and joking supposedly in the midst of a serious tragedy. As Seen on TV : Orlando s Acting Professionals Additionally, there was a Pulse nightclub goer seen immediately making the media rounds on TV following the dramatic shooting event, one Luis Burbano, an actor/model featured in a few Hollywood films, according to his IMDB bio.Here s a YouTube clip featuring Burbano s media appearance   One of the Orlando shooting survivors has admitted to locking an exit door, putting dozens of revelers  lives at risk during the massacre.The revelations about Luis Burbano s actions the night of the shooting have come to light after he gave an interview, saying he  regrets  his second chance at life.Nearby, he saw people moving through a small  employee s only  door hidden behind a curtain, and followed after. On the other side of the door was a narrow hallway where Burbano estimates about 20 people were crawling over each other to get to the exit at the other end. Burbano says he decided to shut the door behind him because the hallway was getting dangerously overcrowded. Here s another out-of-town Pulse club goer, Shawn Royster Santiago, from New York City, who apparently witnessed the shooting and who also happens to have a media/acting and modeling pedigree as well.According to Santiago s ModelMayhem profile it states, [I ve been] modeling and performing in the entertainment industry off and on since i was 11,  having appeared in a variety of projects such as Television/Commercials,  and he currently works as a  Visual Merchandiser.  Watch him in the news clip below shortly after the Orlando shooting attack Additionally, the YouTube video montages another interview with the professional actor and model named Luis Burbano, where he  admits  was blocking an exit at the time of the shooting The media linked personality, Patience Carter, from Philadelphia, PA, has also caused many to ask questions. Watch this YouTube clip from Now the Truth, to see her role in the Orlando story  Here s a review of some previously covered anomalies here at 21WIRE As we previously reported, though the Orlando shooting attack was officially stated to have been carried out around 2am, The Daily Mail published Facebook posts from people apparently inside the club that contradict the main timeline, suggesting the shooting happened much earlier.Here are the Facebook comments featured in the Daily Mail  for review If these time stamps are correct and the posts have not been doctored in any way, then these posts present a pretty major crack in the official timeline of events at Pulse nightclub.Here s another clip with the animated YouTube personality Peekay Truth outlining the Daily Mail time discrepancy associated with the Orlando shooting The UK s Independent published an article displaying an eyewitness account that directly contradicts the lone gunman theory pushed by all major media outlets in the aftermath of the shooting: Police did not immediately name the gunman or provide a possible motive for the attack but officials have classified the rampage as a  domestic terrorism incident , Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said.Javer Antonetti, 53, told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper he was near the back of the dance club when he heard gunfire.  There were so many (shots), at least 40,  he said.  I saw two guys and it was constant, like  pow, pow, pow, . From a logistical stand point Mateen s ability to carry out the shooting by himself seems to be another questionable aspect to an increasingly troubled case.Another club eyewitness Jon Alamo,  heard 20, 40, 50 shots, and then  The music stopped. While the stress of the incident could account for some differences, forensically it s hard to believe Mateen would have been able to have the ability to shoot over hundred people with only 50 some shots.According to multiple eyewitness accounts people inside the club mentioned that there was possibly as many as four shooters in and around the area. The witness seen in the image just below described the following: Then he [Mateen] called someone he knew and he mentioned that he was the fourth shooter, and there were three others. One of the main mainstream media protagonists from the Orlando Shooting event was a man named Chris Hansen, an aspiring actor and entertainer who played a central role as  survivor  and  hero  in a number of heavily rotated media clips depicting the aftermath of the event.

16768,Cambodian PM says main opposition party will be dissolved,"Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said on Monday it was  a fact  that the main opposition party would be dissolved as he spoke on the anniversary of the peace agreement that established multiparty democracy. More than 50 rights groups called on the countries that signed the Paris Peace Agreements in 1991 to reconvene urgently because of the threat to democracy in the Southeast Asian country. Hun Sen s government has asked the supreme court to dissolve the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) after its leader, Kem Sokha, was arrested on Sept. 3 and charged with treason. The court has yet to rule on whether the CNRP will be dissolved.  Because they didn t respect the Paris Peace Agreement, the political party will be dissolved in the future, this is a fact,  Hun Sen said at a ceremony marking the construction of a new bridge in Phnom Penh. Dissolving the party would eliminate the challenge to him prolonging more than 32 years in power in next year s election, but Western donors have criticized the move and called for the release of Kem Sokha. Hun Sen accused the United Nations of failing to bring peace despite organizing the first election in 1993 and said guerrilla fighting had only ended because of his own negotiations with leaders of the genocidal Khmer Rouge. Hun Sen s critics accuse him of trying to turn the country into a one-party state for the ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP). On Sunday, he said any elected officials who defect from the CNRP to his party would be allowed to keep their positions once the opposition party is dissolved. In a joint open letter on Monday, more than 50 rights groups called for the Paris Conference on Cambodia to be reconvened.  There is an urgent need for decisive action from the international community, to ensure that the democratic vision for Cambodia outlined in the Paris Peace Agreements is not completely forsaken,  said the letter. Hun Sen said calls for the original signatories to be reconvened were  out of date and impossible . He noted that one of the signatories, the Soviet Union, no longer exists. In the face of the Western criticism since the arrest of Kem Sokha, China has given verbal support to Hun Sen s government. China is by far the biggest donor to Cambodia and its biggest investor. China s influential Global Times tabloid said in an editorial on Sunday that Cambodia s  growth trend should not be interrupted by the country s rising political tension .  As an important economic partner of Cambodia, China will pay close attention to the situation in the Southeast Asian country and willingly provide the necessary help,  it said.",worldnews,"October 23, 2017 ",0
9459,"Bipartisan Puerto Rico crisis bill introduced, debt looms","U.S. lawmakers on Thursday began coalescing around revised bipartisan legislation to help address Puerto Rico’s unpayable debt burden, which now threatens a full-blown humanitarian crisis. Released close to midnight on Wednesday, the House Natural Resources Committee’s revised bill includes a strong oversight board to direct how and when the island pays its bills and leaves many earlier proposals in place.  Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its roughly $70 billion in debt while trying to cope with a 45 percent poverty rate among its 3.5 million U.S. citizens. In addition, it is reeling from a Zika virus outbreak that is hurting its critical tourism industry. Language allowing Puerto Rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent, known as a “cram-down,” remains. The bill does not prioritize pensioners over bondholders, but the language remains muddied, one analyst surmised. “Tonight, we introduced legislation to responsibly address the crisis in Puerto Rico. The revised bill incorporates technical refinements and input from all stakeholders,” committee Chairman Rob Bishop said in a statement. For a link to a factbox on the bill, click. While both Republican and Democratic leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives welcomed the bill after several delays, how more conservative Republican lawmakers view the legislation is an open question. A vote on the bill by the House is expected in the first week of June, ahead of a looming $1.9 billion debt payment due on July 1. In recent months, the debt crisis has threatened a deepening humanitarian crisis as hospitals close wards, social services decline and emigration saps more economic activity. “After long bipartisan negotiations, we believe we have achieved a restructuring process that can work,” U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on Thursday. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who faces opposition to the bill from within his own Republican ranks, highlighted the bipartisan effort as he will need Democrat votes to get it passed. “Right now, the stability of the U.S. territory is in danger, as the Puerto Rican government continues to default on major loan payments. We have insisted that our response meet basic principles, and first among them is protecting taxpayers from a bailout,” Ryan said in a statement. The bill, formally known as the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), seeks to return the island to solvency, rebuild a base for economic growth and maintain its ability to access capital markets in the future. The White House called the bill an “important first step” in creating a fair process for restructuring Puerto Rico’s debt and economy after a decade of recession. The U.S. territory’s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, said he was encouraged by the bill but chafed at the oversight board, which he believes undermine the island’s self-governance. Choosing the members of the oversight board has been a sticking point in the talks leading up to the introduction of the bill. U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on Thursday he was pleased the bill includes “restructuring tools for Puerto Rico that are comprehensive and workable” but expressed disappointment that proposals to promote economic growth were left out of what he called a “tough bipartisan compromise.”        In the early drafts of the bill, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, said he was not satisfied, meaning a potential hurdle for passing the bill could remain. A conservative Tea Party favorite, Representative Raul Labrador of Idaho, said he was reviewing the bill but told Reuters he thought a majority of Republicans would “support it through both houses of Congress.” Many creditors lobbied for a bill that does not create new precedents for how they might be treated in a restructuring which would potentially set up future legal fights on the U.S. mainland that are far away from the island’s current crisis. “The bill, which creates a control board and allows for bankruptcy, is highly controversial and does not definitively protect any creditors. We believe the legislation is more positive for both GO and COFINA creditors than the legislation previously under review,” wrote Heights Securities analyst Daniel Hanson. Hanson said the bill lacks clarity over the treatment of constitutionally protected bondholders versus pensioners. A local bondholder group said it supported the bill. “As imperfect as it may be, the bipartisan bill is the ‘pause’ that is desperately needed so everyone can come together to forge a bright future for all Americans living in Puerto Rico,” said Jorge Irizarry, president of the Backyard Bondholders, which represents more than 60,000 resident bondholders in Puerto Rico.   GO, or General Obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the island and are senior to all debt, while COFINA debt is backed by sales tax revenues. “This territories-clause bill, which will bring all creditors to the table and establish a strong and independent fiscal oversight board, should appeal to conservatives who were concerned about a ‘bailout’ or ‘contagion,’” the COFINA Senior Bondholders Ad Hoc Group said in a statement.  Investors bid up prices on Puerto Rico’s benchmark July 2035 GO debt to 66, a gain of 0.50 point in price to yield 12.797 percent, according to MSRB data.",politicsNews,"May 19, 2016 ",0
5109,WATCH: Gun Nut Believes Trump’s ‘Second Amendment’ Threat Is A Call To Arms,"Donald Trump s  Second Amendment  threat just took a more frightening turn.National outrage ensued after the Republican nominee suggested on Tuesday that gun owners do something to stop Hillary Clinton from nominating judges to the Supreme Court. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,  Trump said.  Although the Second Amendment people   maybe there is, I don t know. This statement prompted the Secret Service to take the unprecedented step of responding to an assassination threat by a presidential candidate against an opposing candidate, whom the Secret Service is charged with protecting and would be in the line of fire should a right-wing gun nut answer Trump s dog whistle.And it appears that at least one gun nut is interpreting Trump s dog whistle call as a call for armed insurrection if Hillary Clinton becomes president and doesn t pick who they want her to pick as a Supreme Court Justice.Greg from Michigan called into C-SPAN on Wednesday morning and while he denied that Trump was calling for Hillary to be shot and killed he frighteningly declared that Trump was actually calling for a bloody armed revolt if conservatives don t get their way. Number one, Mr. Trump was not threatening assassination of Hillary. But what he was implying and could happen is if Hillary got her way and did do away with Second Amendment rights, there are a lot of us who are gun owners who are going to object to that very strongly. And since we do have firearms, it might if it comes down to it be us having to defend our rights with those guns, just as the revolutionaries did in the Revolutionary War. Here s the video via C-SPAN:Trump s rhetoric just took a scary turn and his supporters are taking him seriously. Republicans have talked about  Second Amendment remedies  before but American voters have been consistent in rejecting candidates who spew such rhetoric. The idea of using guns to force your political agenda on the country is a threat to our democracy and has no place in this country. It s time for voters to once again reject this rhetoric by defeating Trump by a landslide. Republicans need to learn once and for all that threats of gun violence is not a political strategy and is a sure way to lose elections.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"August 10, 2016",0

6134,"Trump to sign orders to renegotiate NAFTA, pull out of TPP: NBC","U.S. President Donald Trump could sign an executive order as early as Monday intended to renegotiate the free trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico, NBC News reported, citing an unidentified White House official. In addition to wanting to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the new Republican president also intends to sign an executive order pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), NBC reported. Trump, who was sworn in as the 45th U.S. president on Friday, targeted both trade pacts during his White House campaign.  Officials were not immediately available to confirm the report to Reuters. Trump’s official schedule includes a 10:30  a.m. EST (1530 GMT) signing of executive orders in the Oval Office. The president said on Sunday he planned talks soon with the leaders of Canada and Mexico to begin renegotiating NAFTA. “We will be starting negotiations having to do with NAFTA,” Trump said at a swearing-in ceremony for his top White House advisers. “We are going to start renegotiating on NAFTA, on immigration and on security at the border.” Trump said during the campaign he wanted to secure more favorable terms for the United States in the NAFTA pact. NAFTA, which took effect in 1994, and other trade deals became lightning rods for voter anger in the U.S. industrial heartland states that swept Trump to victory. CNN reported the first executive action Trump intended to sign was to pull out of the TPP, the trade agreement among 11 Pacific Rim countries that Democratic President Barack Obama strongly backed but was never ratified by the Republican-controlled Congress.",politicsNews,"January 23, 2017 ",0

18388,"U.S. expels 15 Cuban diplomats, fuelling tensions with Havana","The Trump administration on Tuesday expelled 15 Cuban diplomats to protest Cuba s failure to protect staff at the U.S. embassy in Havana from a mysterious spate of health  attacks,  spurring new tensions between the former Cold War foes. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the expulsions from Cuba s embassy in Washington were also intended to ensure  equity  in staffing levels, after he recalled more than half the U.S. diplomatic personnel in Havana on Friday. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez denounced the decision as  unjustified,  accused the United States of insufficient cooperation with Cuba s investigation of the health incidents and urged Washington to stop politicizing the matter. The steps taken by Republican President Donald Trump s administration delivers another blow to his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama s policy of rapprochement, including actions likely to erode the normalization of a relationship dominated for decades by mutual hostility and suspicion. The latest U.S. move was communicated to Cuban Ambassador Jose Ramon Cabanas on Tuesday, and the diplomats were given seven days to leave, a State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Until the Government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba, our embassy will be reduced to emergency personnel to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,  Tillerson said in a statement.  We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks,  he added. The United States announced on Friday that it was sharply reducing its diplomatic presence in Cuba, as it warned U.S. citizens not to visit the Communist-ruled island because of the alleged attacks it says have caused hearing loss, dizziness and fatigue in 22 U.S. embassy personnel. The State Department had said the embassy was halting regular visa operations for Cubans seeking to visit the United States and would offer only emergency services to U.S. citizens. Cuba has denied involvement in any attacks and says it has reinforced security for U.S. diplomatic personnel. Rodriguez said lack of U.S. cooperation had stymied its own investigation into the matter. Authorities had not provided access to the injured people and the doctors who examined them, or to the homes where the attacks allegedly took place, he said, adding that evidence had been delivered late.  Rodriguez urged the United States to cooperate more and said Cuba was also working with Canada on the investigation as Canadian diplomats have reported similar symptoms. So far, none of the probes have yielded any answers about how the alleged attacks were carried out or who was responsible. Several Cuban-American Republican lawmakers, including U.S Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, had urged that Cuban diplomats be kicked out in retaliation for the Cuban government s failure to get to the bottom of the attacks.  I commend the U.S. State Department for expelling a number of Cuban operatives from the U.S.,  Rubio, an influential voice on Trump s Cuba policy, said in a statement. But James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a Washington-based pro-engagement lobbying group said:  This decision appears to be purely political, driven by the desire of a handful of individuals in Congress to halt progress between our two countries.   It looks like we are returning the threats and tensions of the 1960s,  said Maria Fernandez, a 45-year-old office worker in Havana.  This is madness by Trump. It s really sad, because we are so close, and yet so far away from a sincere rapprochement.  Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor Obama after five decades of hostility, called the Cuban government  corrupt and destabilizing  in his address to the United Nations last month. Cuba described his comments as  unacceptable and meddling.  Rodriguez urged the United States  not to continue politicizing this matter, which can provoke an undesirable escalation and could rarify and reverse even more bilateral relations.  In Havana, U.S. diplomats frantically selling off their belongings at garage sales and on social media, said they were disappointed to be ordered to leave. In a message on Facebook, the embassy s top official, career diplomat Scott Hamilton, said he would also be leaving.  I am an optimist and hope we will return one day, before too long,  he wrote.

Fortunately, no one was stung (though we can probably expect to hear on Fox News that Obama tried to kill a bunch of kids).Ultimately, the President did something that is much like interacting with a Republican-led Congress: He did his best to calm the children down, floundered for a bit while the hysteria was at its peak, finally succeeded in restoring order, and got back to business.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Posted by BuzzFeed News on Monday, March 28, 2016All in all, it was a rousing success and everyone had fun.

6598,Mistrial declared in corruption case against ex-Los Angeles sheriff,"A federal judge declared a mistrial on Thursday in the obstruction of justice case against former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, ruling that jurors were hopelessly deadlocked, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. Baca, aged 74 and suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, was standing trial on charges of trying to thwart a federal corruption probe that overshadowed the final years of his tenure as chief custodian of the nation’s largest county jail system. U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson’s determination of a hung jury came during the fourth day of deliberations following a series of confidential “sidebar” talks between Anderson and the attorneys, joined at times by Baca and one of the jurors. After a final 30-minute round of deliberations, the 12-member panel said it could not reach a unanimous verdict and that further efforts were fruitless. Anderson then pronounced the jurors “hopelessly deadlocked” and dismissed them, according to Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for prosecutors. Jurors said afterward they had split 11-1 in favor of acquittal, local media reported. Anderson set a hearing for Jan. 10 on how to proceed. Prosecutors must decide whether to seek a retrial of Baca on charges of obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. The case stems from a wide-ranging federal investigation of inmate abuse by sheriff’s deputies and other wrongdoing, including cover-up attempts, at two downtown Los Angeles jails. The defense contended that Baca was unaware of efforts inside his department to impede the investigation and that his former second-in-command, Paul Tanaka, was to blame.  Tanaka is serving a five-year sentence for his role in the corruption scandal, the highest ranking of 17 officials convicted in related cases. Baca has been slated to stand trial separately on a charge of making false statements to federal investigators, for which he plans to raise Alzheimer’s as a defense. Baca pleaded guilty last February to the false statement charge but withdrew his plea in August after a judge ruled that the six-month prison term prosecutors recommended as part of the deal was too lenient.  He was indicted days later on all three charges of obstruction, conspiracy and making false statements, for which he could face 20 years in prison if convicted. Baca was the top elected law enforcement official in Los Angeles for 15 years before retiring in January 2014 amid the corruption probe at the county jail system, which houses some 18,000 inmates.",politicsNews,"December 22, 2016 ",1

14650,IS GOP ESTABLISHMENT Responsible For Pro-Amnesty Spanish Version Of Nikki Haley’s GOP Response To Obama’s SOTU? [Video],"This is a very big development. We all knew the GOP establishment has been pandering to pro-amnesty corporations and the Chamber of Commerce, but this is a new low, even for the GOP establishment There is a bigger controversy about to break wide-open that s potentially far more significant than Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell approving Nikki Haley s non-subtle attack on GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. That bigger controversy is the Spanish version of the GOP State of the Union rebuttal containing an  amnesty pledge .As this is written, Governor Nikki Haley is trying to get out ahead of the building expose . Haley just gave a DC press conference claiming she does not support  amnesty ; however, against her earlier admission of Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell approving her script   the Spanish version must have held similar approvals.Governor Haley gave the English version, Miami Representative and party-insider Mario Diaz-Barlat delivered it in Spanish.ENGLISH:SPANISH:Here s a (paragraph by paragraph) comparison as translated by the Miami Herald (emphasis mine):  English (Via Haley): No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.Spanish (Via Diaz-Barlat): No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love the United States should ever feel unwelcome in this country. It s not who we are.  English: At the same time, that does not mean we just flat out open our borders. We can t do that. We cannot continue to allow immigrants to come here illegally. And in this age of terrorism, we must not let in refugees whose intentions cannot be determined.Spanish: At the same time, it s obvious that our immigration system needs to be reformed. The current system puts our national security at risk and is an obstacle for our economy.  English: We must fix our broken immigration system. That means stopping illegal immigration. And it means welcoming properly vetted legal immigrants, regardless of their race or religion. Just like we have for centuries.Spanish: It s essential that we find a legislative solution to protect our nation, defend our borders, offer a permanent and human solution to those who live in the shadows, respect the rule of law, modernize the visa system and push the economy forward.  English: I have no doubt that if we act with proper focus, we can protect our borders, our sovereignty and our citizens, all while remaining true to America s noblest legacies.Spanish: I have no doubt that if we work together, we can achieve this and continue to be faithful to the noblest legacies of the United States.It is important to remember the backdrop to this current dual narrative (one the GOPe leadership want to say publicly and one they wish to keep hidden).Back in June 2014 Speaker John Boehner was only two days away from calling up the vote on the Senate  gang-of-eight  amnesty bill, when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was defeated in the Virginia Primary.Mario Diaz Balart along with Paul Ryan and Luis V. Gutierrez were in secret negotiations throughout the spring/summer of 2014 planning the pathway for comprehensive immigration reform. John Boehner asked Kevin McCarthy to  whip the house  and identify if they had votes for passage:[ ] On Tuesday June 10th Speaker Boehner, Eric Cantor (Majority Leader) and Kevin McCarthy (Majority Whip) had lunch together discussing timing the vote Thursday night or Friday Morning.However, later that same night the results from the 2014 Virginia primary showed an unknown conservative outsider, Dave Brat, had defeated (primaried) Eric Cantor. At 7:00pm Tuesday night the first word went out that Cantor had lost.~ Full Back StorySo this hidden narrative within the 2016 Republican State of the Union Rebuttal should come as no surprise. Comprehensive Immigration Reform is the GOPe agenda they continue to hide from the electorate.Via: Conservative Treehouse",politics,"Jan 14, 2016",1

12142,Wounded North Korean defector transferred to South Korean military hospital,"A North Korean soldier who suffered critical gunshot wounds during a defection dash across the border to South Korea has been transferred to a military hospital, a South Korean intelligence official said on Saturday. The North Korean soldier, 24-year-old Oh Chong Song, was transferred to the military hospital on Friday from a trauma center at Ajou University Hospital south of Seoul, where his treatment for gunshot wounds and pre-existing conditions included two major operations.   Oh has been transferred to South Korea s military hospital and South Korea s intelligence services will soon schedule the security questioning process depending on Oh s condition,  the intelligence official told Reuters. The official, who declined to be identified, also declined to provide a specific schedule for Oh s questioning.   Oh was shot and badly wounded by his fellow North Korean soldiers while fleeing across the border into the South in November.  Three South Korean soldiers brought Oh to safety and he was immediately taken aboard a U.S. Black Hawk military helicopter and rushed into surgery.  Medical staff at the Armed Forces Hospital will continue to provide proper care and treatment for Oh,  a South Korean defense ministry official. Surgeon John Cook-Jong Lee accompanied Oh, along with a few South Korean intelligence services agents and other medical crew, as he was airlifted by a South Korean military helicopter to the Korean Armed Forces Capital Hospital in Seongnam, south of Seoul.  Oh is still recovering from two major surgeries and other minor injuries. He has not gained full strength yet, but his condition has been much stabilized,  said a person familiar with Oh s condition, who declined to be identified.",worldnews,"December 16, 2017 ",1

16743,Southeast Asian ministers urge North Korea to rein in weapons programs,"Southeast Asian defense ministers on Monday expressed  grave concern  over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs and urged the reclusive country to meet its international obligations and resume communications.  North Korea is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland and has ignored all calls, even from its lone major ally, China, to rein in its weapons programs which it conducts in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Defense ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), in a joint statement, underscored the  need to maintain peace and stability in the region  and called  for the exercise of self-restraint and the resumption of dialogue to de-escalate tensions in the Korean peninsula . They are due to meet with their counterparts from the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, Russia and New Zealand on Tuesday when North Korea, the disputed South China Sea and terrorism are expected to top the agenda. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said he will talk with Asian allies about North Korea and the crisis caused by its  reckless  provocations. Mattis s trip to Asia, which will also include stops in Thailand and South Korea, comes just weeks before Donald Trump s first visit to Asia as U.S. president.

They also vowed to work together to combat terrorism as they condemned the attack by the Maute militant group in the southern Philippine city of Marawi.

16975,“GOOD-BYE SWEDEN”: How Muslim Violence…Porous Borders And Horrible Health Care Drove Swedish Blogger To U.S.A.,"This blogger s piece is a glimpse into the future of America. Unless we all find a way to stand together and stop Barack Obama and the Democrat party s fundamental transformation from happening we ll be looking for another country who cares more about its citizens than its immigrant population This is the last post on this blog. I am leaving Sweden for good shortly, and will no longer be following its descent from what was once the third most prosperous country in the world. Frankly, it s just too damn depressing.I was born and raised in Sweden, which leaves a cultural mark even though I moved to USA in the 1990s and have spent the better part of my adult life as an American. Coming back for a few years has been a shocking experience.When I was a child, Sweden was a dull yet very safe place to live. Yes, there was a heavy blanket of socialism and collectivist values covering everything, but there was a core of pragmatism beneath the redness. The intention and goal was always to benefit the citizens, even though they went about things in a backwards manner.Prime minister L fven Today, it s as if the inmates are running the asylum. The politicians are participating in a chicken race of  goodness  where everybody tries to one-up each other in caring for the citizens of OTHER countries while Swedish retirees, school children, handicapped and other vulnerable categories of people are thorougly ignored. Violence is exploding. Jihadist Trojan horses are flowing through the porous border along with the tens of thousands ID-less refugees.But what makes me the most pessimistic about Sweden s future is how the social fabric itself has been undermined.Now, to be clear, it is my opinion that modest immigration is healthy for society and beneficial for trade, cultural development and so forth. Protectionism as a concept is counter-productive, while free trade and the ability for skilled labor to go where they re in demand is beneficial for everyone.Having said that, what Sweden is doing is something completely different. The once homogenous population has been forever altered by a rapid and massive addition of people from vastly different cultures and value-systems. 26,8% of the population is now foreign-born or with at least one foreign-born parent, and the national census bureau estimates that some 150 000 per year will arrive to the country of just 9,8 million residents.There simply is no possible way to absorb and assimilate such volumes of people, period. Then you are merely creating ethnic enclaves, which due to incompatible language, culture and job skills become ghettos, which in turns brews crime, misery and extremism. Once the inflow has exceeded the capacity for absorbtion, further immigration only makes the problem worse.It s like someone having read that a cup of green tea per day is healthy, so they make it a policy to chug four gallons per day, every day. It s a good thing overdone to the extreme until it becomes toxic.Then you have the Swedish school system. There really is no nice way to put it; it s a complete disaster. The minister of education is a man-boy who spends his time making Youtube-videos showing heart-signs with his hands to boost school results, while university-level students can t read and comprehend the course literature.Education minister Gustav FridolinSince there is a delay in the changes in the school system, it is only in recent years the full impact of the knowledge-averse  progressive  school system is starting to be felt. Hard facts are largely irrelevant; the important thing is to sit in a group and discuss things until a consensus is reached. But with no hard facts to base the conclusions on, it becomes an exercise in futility because it s all random assumptions and opinions. As a university-level history student (!) was quoted as saying in newspaper Svenska Dagbladet the other day:  Why would all these dates matter? Who cares in what order things happened? That s not exactly fertile soil for creating the researchers and engineers of the future.Financially, Sweden is an oddity in that it never had its real estate correction when Lehman Bros went belly-up and the housing market everywhere in the West crashed. Sweden just kept steaming ahead, which means housing is ridiculously overinflated. In Stockholm, the real estate prices increased 19% and in Gothenburg 24% in the last 12 months alone   from an already sky-high level.Tear-down abandoned house from 1932 with small, unremarkable lot in the outskirts of Stockholm. Current bid: 7,5 million SEK, or close to $900,000.As a result, personal debt of the Swedish population is at an all-time high. To keep all this afloat the normal mortgage interest rates are at 2% with central bank Riksbanken at -0,25%, and yet a significant portion of the borrowers are hanging by a thread. If and when foreign banks and investors decide it s time to turn their backs on Sweden (as happened in the early 1990s) there s going to be a lot of pain.Then you have the financial obligations going forward. Like much of the western world, there is a demographic change where fewer tax-paying adults are to support a glut of retirees. What makes it especially dire for Sweden is that in addition to the old Swedes, there s also a ton of elderly immigrants that are granted  family visas  based on younger relatives having been granted asylum. They ve never paid a dime in taxes, yet enter the system with full benefits from day one. In theory, this would be made up for by the younger relatives working and paying taxes. Sadly, this is not the case; while ethnical Swedes have a 82% employment rate, immigrants only have 57% with non-Europeans coming in at just 51%.If Sweden was a person, it d be like the guy with three mortgages, seven maxed-out credit cards and four collection agencies chasing him that just signed a lease for a brand new BMW X6. Simply put, there s a lot of red ink in the future; it just hasn t been fully realized yet.Finally, there s the sorry state of the Swedish defense. After decades of constant slashing of the defense budget, the extent of Swedish ambition is to stall an invader for a week in a limited area. This with war raging in Europe, Russian missiles pointed at Sweden in Kaliningrad, and Russian submarines and bomber jets openly thumbing their nose at Sweden as they intrude on Swedish territory on a regular basis. The power vacuum in Scandinavia is so tangible you can almost hear a sucking sound as you fly over it. This, too, will require massive investments when the penny finally drops amongst Swedish politicians.So while I can t claim to be any kind of authority on macroeconomics or social predictive models, I see red lights across the board.In some ways, I d compare the country to a farm. Previously, Sweden acted like a sensible farmer and planted wheat here, carrots there, potatoes over there et cetera, by implementing free schooling, sound infrastructure investments, state-financed research and so forth. A few decades later, they reaped the rewards and climbed the prosperity ladder.In the late 1960s, this pragmatic line was abandoned as leftist idealist Olof Palme took over. But there was plenty to harvest from previous years, so Sweden continued to be the land of milk and honey for a good long while. Then things started drying up, and the process has been one of gradual erosion and decline since the 1990s.The famous Swedish health care system is a good example. 120 000 hospital beds in the late 1960s became 20 000 today. Cancer patients are put on waiting lists for months. Entire emergency wards shut down for summer. The crumbling Swedish railroad system is another symptom I examined in-depth last year. The aforementioned defense that now consist of about three fat generals and a rusty rifle (bullets withheld for budgetary reasons).A sensible farmer would see the problems for what they are and hurry to plant new seeds, so as to return to bountiful harvests of wheat, carrots, potatoes etc. Instead, the Swedish politicians goes by dogma and plants what they think SHOULD grow. So they plant M & Ms, hot dogs and pretzels. The results won t be fully evident for a few years yet, but as the last reserves of the old harvests are depleted, things will get  Interesting.From what I can see, there simply is no plausible scenario where these social tensions and future financial committments will not lead to a downward spiral of hardship and strife. I hope I m wrong. I really do, because I have friends and family I care about that will remain here to see it all play out.But I won t. I ll be back in the US being mad at Obama for being a lying scumbag. And if Trump manages to get elected in 2016? Whoo boy. A racist ignoramus who takes pride in the worst qualities of a cranky eight-year old should make George  Dumbo  Bush seem like Abe Lincoln by comparison. So every country has its problems. USA has its corrupt yokel in office, just as Sweden has Stefan L fven. Via: The Sweden Report",Government News,"Nov 11, 2015",1
9121,Trump revokes Washington Post's campaign press credentials,"U.S. Republican Donald Trump said on Monday he will no longer issue press credentials to the Washington Post, stopping the publication from gaining access to press areas at his presidential campaign events. The Washington Post, based in the U.S. capital, is one the country’s the most influential newspapers and has one of the largest circulations.  “They have no journalistic integrity and write falsely about Mr. Trump,” his campaign said in a statement explaining the decision. “Mr. Trump does not mind a bad story, but it has to be honest.” Trump’s campaign repeated criticism the candidate has made of Post owner Jeff Bezos, who also owns online retailer Amazon.com. It is unusual for a presidential campaign to refuse to issue credentials to news organizations. Credentials are needed for reporters, photographers and other staff to gain access to press seating, travel with the campaign and attend media-only events, like press conferences. “Donald Trump’s decision to revoke The Washington Post’s press credentials is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press,” the newspaper’s editor, Marty Baron, said in a statement. “When coverage doesn’t correspond to what the candidate wants it to be, then a news organization is banished. The Post will continue to cover Donald Trump as it has all along — honorably, honestly, accurately, energetically, and unflinchingly. We’re proud of our coverage, and we’re going to keep at it.” A source close to the campaign said the ban could be temporary and pointed out that Trump has already barred other new organizations, including Politico, from obtaining press credentials and then reversed course. Ben Smith, executive editor of Buzzfeed, responded that his news organization, which targets millennials, is also banned from covering official Trump events. The Huffington Post posted on Twitter that its reporters are also barred. “A candidate for the highest elected office in the land doesn’t get to choose what goes in a newspaper,” said Committee to Protect Journalist Deputy Executive Director Robert Mahoney. “It provides a ready-made excuse for authoritarian leaders to crackdown further on independent journalists. We urge Donald Trump to reconsider and let the Washington Post do its job.” Trump’s campaign took issue with an article that appeared on The Washington Post’s website earlier on Monday with the headline, “Donald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting’ as their headline.” The headline was changed to “Donald Trump seems to connect President Obama to Orlando shooting” within an hour after it was published. The Washington Post has assigned a team of reporters to produce a book about Trump that is scheduled to be released later this year.",politicsNews,"June 13, 2016 ",0
9173,“GUATEMALAN” MAN DIES After Falling Into WASTE GRINDER At Meat Plant…Former Worker Claims They Hire “90% Illegal Aliens”…Including “10-12 Yr Old Kids”,"This story is absolutely horrific, but not surprising. Bleeding heart liberals aren t doing illegal aliens any favors by fighting for them to come here, only to be abused by their employers, who hire them, and then hold their illegal immigration status over their heads when they demand safer working conditions. (See video below)A worker caught in a machine at a meat processing plant has died in Ohio, according to local authorities.Samuel Martinez, 62, was killed by the machine on Saturday afternoon at the Fresh Mark plant in Canton, Ohio.The  Guatemalan national  died at the scene.According to the Stark County Coroner s Office, the man stepped into a chute and was stuck in the waste grinder.In a statement released on Saturday, Fresh Mark said that they would work with local law enforcement to figure out what caused the accident.This afternoon just before 5 pm, we experienced a work-related fatality at our Canton facility, they said. Our primary concern rests with the wellbeing of this employee s family, as well as with the safety and well-being of all our employees in the Canton and other Fresh Mark facilities. We are working with authorities to determine the facts regarding this incident. The incident marks the second of such to happen at the company.In 2011, an employee was electrocuted while trying to plug in a fan as he was standing in water.The company sells pork related meat under the Superior and Sugardale brands.  Daily Mail In 2011, Steve Salvi, the founder of Ohio Jobs & Justice PAC interviewed an Ohio worker that made some startling allegations regarding the alleged hiring of underaged illegal aliens at one of Fresh Mark s Sugardale meatpacking plants in Canton, Ohio. In addition to outing the company for hiring underage illegal alien workers, the former Fresh Mark employee claims a veteran returned from Iraq and applied for a job at the meat processing company. The veteran was allegedly turned down until he could prove that he spoke the Spanish language.In May 2017, the very liberal New Yorker published a story about a 17-year old Guatemalan boy who was too young to work in a factory, and lost his leg due to the unsafe working conditions at neighboring Case Farms in Ohio. The New Yorker says the Case Farms plants are among the most dangerous workplaces in America.Osiel sanitized the liver-giblet chiller, a tublike contraption that cools chicken innards by cycling them through a near-freezing bath, then looked for a ladder, so that he could turn off the water valve above the machine. As usual, he said, there weren t enough ladders to go around, so he did as a supervisor had shown him: he climbed up the machine, onto the edge of the tank, and reached for the valve. His foot slipped; the machine automatically kicked on. Its paddles grabbed his left leg, pulling and twisting until it snapped at the knee and rotating it a hundred and eighty degrees, so that his toes rested on his pelvis. The machine  literally ripped off his left leg,  medical reports said, leaving it hanging by a frayed ligament and a five-inch flap of skin. Osiel was rushed to Mercy Medical Center, where surgeons amputated his lower leg.Case Farms plants are among the most dangerous workplaces in America. In 2015 alone, federal workplace-safety inspectors fined the company nearly two million dollars, and in the past seven years, it has been cited for two hundred and forty violations. That s more than any other company in the poultry industry except Tyson Foods, which has more than thirty times as many employees. David Michaels, the former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), called Case Farms  an outrageously dangerous place to work.  Four years before 17 year old Guatemalan worker, Osiel L pez P rez lost his leg, Michaels s inspectors had seen Case Farms employees standing on top of machines to sanitize them and warned the company that someone would get hurt. Just a week before Osiel s accident, an inspector noted in a report that Case Farms had repeatedly taken advantage of loopholes in the law and given the agency false information.  The company has a twenty-five-year track record of failing to comply with federal workplace-safety standards,  Michaels said.Case Farms has built its business by recruiting some of the world s most vulnerable immigrants, who endure harsh and at times illegal conditions that few Americans would put up with. When these workers have fought for higher pay and better conditions, the company has used their immigration status to get rid of vocal workers, avoid paying for injuries, and quash dissent. Thirty years ago, Congress passed an immigration law mandating fines and even jail time for employers who hire unauthorized workers, but trivial penalties and weak enforcement have allowed employers to evade responsibility. Under President Obama, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agreed not to investigate workers during labor disputes. Advocates worry that President Trump, whose Administration has targeted unauthorized immigrants, will scrap those agreements, emboldening employers to simply call ice anytime workers complain.",politics,"Dec 17, 2017",1
10045,Trump opponents buoyed after front-runner's Wisconsin loss,"Donald Trump’s Republican rivals were invigorated on Wednesday by the front-runner’s loss in the Wisconsin primary and moved quickly to bolster efforts to block the New York billionaire from capturing the party’s presidential nomination. Ted Cruz’s emphatic victory in Wisconsin on Tuesday night dealt momentum to his once long-shot bid to force a contested convention in July by blocking Trump from amassing enough delegates to secure the nomination.  The U.S. senator from Texas made the case he is increasingly viewed as the main Trump alternative by Republicans who cannot bring themselves to support Trump as their nominee for the Nov. 8 election. Allies of Ohio Governor John Kasich, who is positioning himself as a mainstream candidate who could emerge from a contested convention, met in Washington to brainstorm about how they could use obscure procedural rules to their advantage when the party convenes in Cleveland. One group trying to defeat Trump, who has alarmed many Republican establishment figures with his comments on immigration, Muslims and trade, was hopeful on Wednesday of a cash infusion to fund their efforts. “Our funders are committed to nominating a principled conservative that can win in November and can help Republicans up and down the ballot,” said Katie Packer, who is leading the anti-Trump Our Principals PAC. “They understand that this is a long slog now and they are supportive of our mission and strategy. I expect that we will have the funds necessary to execute.” U.S. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, lobbyists and congressional staffers were among those who met with Kasich advisers on Wednesday to discuss what one Republican congressional staffer present admitted was the governor’s “long-shot” bid. He has won only his home state in nominating contests so far. Kasich’s campaign has “a plan going into the convention ... and if the convention goes to a brokered convention, they have a legitimate chance,” the staffer said. The next big test in stopping Trump will be New York, the state he calls home. A Monmouth University poll of New York Republicans released on Monday showed Trump with 52 percent of the state’s support, a huge lead over Kasich at 25 percent, and Cruz at 17 percent ahead of the state’s April 19 primary. Trump held a rally in Bethpage, New York, on Wednesday evening where he referred only obliquely to his Wisconsin loss,  saying it “takes guts” to run for president and criticizing Cruz for drawing small crowds in the state. The Trump campaign also announced members of its New York-based team, including party leaders in each of the state’s 27 congressional districts. “It’s very important for Trump to bounce back strong. The sense of his inevitability is one of his strengths,” said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Center at Southern Illinois University. Cruz met with black and Hispanic religious leaders earlier in the day in the New York City borough of the Bronx. “The men and women of Wisconsin resoundingly rejected (Trump’s) campaign,” Cruz told reporters afterward. “Donald has no solutions to the problems that we’re facing.” A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday showed Cruz statistically even with Trump among Republicans nationally. His recent gains marked the first time since November that a rival had threatened Trump’s standing at the head of the Republican pack. Trump has 743 delegates, Cruz 517, and Kasich 143, according to an Associated Press count. Trump would need to win about 55 percent of the remaining delegates to reach the 1,237 threshold. “We fully expect this to go to Cleveland,” Packer said of the anti-Trump effort. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders, a Brooklyn-born U.S. senator representing Vermont, is trying to stage a come-from-behind upset of Hillary Clinton, but will struggle to overcome a large deficit in delegates.  Sanders’ big win in Wisconsin, which brought his victory tally to six out of the last seven contests, added to Clinton’s frustration over her inability to knock out a rival who has attacked her from the left. That frustration was on full display on Wednesday when the former secretary of state gave two live televised interviews in which she criticized Sanders. In contrast to a Republican primary season that has been rife with personal insults, the Democrats have largely avoided personal attacks and stuck to policy arguments. But Clinton attacked Sanders for his position on guns and said he lacked a depth of policy understanding. “You can’t really help people if you don’t know how to do what you say you want to do,” Clinton said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” She criticized him for an interview to New York’s Daily News in which he failed to offer specifics on how he would break up large banks - a key part of his campaign message - when he was asked how he would put to use the existing financial regulation Dodd-Frank law.  “It’s not clear that he knows how Dodd-Frank works,” Clinton told CNN in an interview on Wednesday afternoon.

6753,SEC Chair White defies Republican requests to stall rulemaking,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White on Monday defied requests by Senate Republicans to delay adopting new rules on everything from derivatives to mutual funds until after President-elect Donald Trump takes office. In a letter to the Senate Banking Committee’s top two Republicans, Chairman Richard Shelby and Mike Crapo of Idaho, White stressed it was “incumbent” on the SEC to “exhibit a spirit of firm independence” in performing its regulatory duties “without fear or favor.”  White’s Dec. 12 letter, which was reviewed by Reuters, comes in response to a request last month by Shelby and Crapo for the SEC to cease adopting rules until after Trump had a chance to review the agency’s agenda.  Republicans in Congress have been pressing agencies across the federal government to wind down their rulemaking activities.    Trump has vowed to kill many regulations put on the books during the Obama administration, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.  White, an independent, is slated to step down from her post at the end of Democratic President Barack Obama’s term in January.  The Senate failed to confirm Obama’s two nominees for vacant commissioner slots at the SEC before it recessed last week, which means that after White departs next month, the SEC will only be left with two commissioners - one Democrat and one Republican.  Even before she leaves, she could still fail to get the rules passed if she cannot get a quorum of commissioners to agree. Trump has yet to announce a nominee for SEC chair, but many of the people working on his financial regulatory transition team, such as former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, have been highly critical of many of the SEC’s rules and Dodd-Frank more broadly. In White’s letter on Monday, she provided Shelby and Crapo with a list of all the rules currently ready for a vote.  Among the rules on the list are derivatives reforms mandated by Dodd-Frank, such as capital and margin requirements for swap dealers, as well as a more controversial one that would limit how mutual funds and exchange-traded funds use derivatives to leverage returns. The letter did not say when the SEC might vote on the rules. The agency could do it during an open meeting or behind closed doors. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on the timing. “I am not insensitive to the issues raised by your letter and have carefully considered what impact, if any, the election should have on the current work of the Commission,” White wrote. She added that she had confirmed that the SEC “historically has proceeded with its work during comparable post-election periods.”     In support of her position, White included footnotes in her letter citing prior statements by Republican SEC Commissioner Mike Piwowar, who is poised to become acting chair in January, in which he voiced support for completing new derivatives rules. This is not the first time the SEC has faced criticism on efforts to complete rules before a change in leadership at the regulator. In 2005, a federal appeals court sided with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in a dispute with the SEC over controversial rules requiring the majority of mutual fund board directors to be independent. The court sent the rule back to the SEC with a directive to consider its costs.  Then-SEC Chairman William Donaldson promptly scheduled a meeting and the SEC re-adopted it a day before his resignation, saying the rule would not be overly costly. The rule was subsequently overturned a second time, and the court chided the SEC for failing to follow proper rulemaking procedures. Even if White is successful in adopting final rules in the coming weeks, Congress may have a way to undo them when Trump takes office on Jan. 20. By law, Congress can vote to reverse regulations within 60 legislative days of them becoming final - which could be easier to accomplish under a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.",politicsNews,"December 12, 2016 ",0

He took beatings in the infamous Bloody Sunday massacre in Selma, Alabama at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. Of course, after Donald Trump was elected, Rep. Lewis, like all sane people, was horrified, and questioned his legitimacy. This led Trump to strike out in his usual petty   and in this case, racist   fashion, and the two have been on the outs ever since. Therefore, What John Lewis had to say to Hillary Clinton for her birthday on Twitter is sure to reignite the feud. Rep. Lewis simply tweeted:Happy Birthday, Madame President @HillaryClinton  John Lewis (@repjohnlewis) October 26, 2017Of course, the Russians helped elect Trump, and Hillary won the popular vote by more than three million people. Further, Trump is clearly unfit for the office he is currently squatting in, and he is destroying our democracy as we speak. The Electors should have refused to certify his election, and the Electoral College should have functioned as the Founders intended. Further, the American public elected Hillary Clinton, a quirk that allowed a few counties in a few states to flip the electoral votes   along with the Russians   elected Trump. He is illegitimate. So, to that end, hats off, Rep. Lewis, and to our beloved Hillary Clinton   Happy birthday, Madame President!Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 26, 2017",1
12753,BREAKING: 28 YR OLD PALESTINIAN MUSLIM Feras Mohamed Freitekh Crashes Plane Near Pratt Whitney HQ’s…Instructor Pilot Said “It Was Intentional”…Media Says Motive Is Still Mystery…LOL!,"28 year old Abdullah Faris Freatekh, aka Feras Mohamed Freitekh was a Muslim with a Palestinian backgroundThe National Transportation Safety Board s initial investigation of a Tuesday s aircraft crash in East Hartford, Connecticut should be a serious concern as it was a possible attempt to destroy one major US military defense contractor. As it seems, Muslims are possibly attempting to carry out an attack by using airplanes again.The investigation by The National Transportation Safety Board also indicates the crash is the result of an intentional act, which means the likelihood this involves an act of terrorism. FBI and police have also raided the pilot s apartment and are questioning three of the associates of Feras M. Freitekh, the pilot. The Jordanian students were also studying to become pilots.Freitekh who was killed on impact is a 28-year-old Jordanian national from a Palestinian background who was studying to become a pilot died after crashing a small plane Tuesday afternoon in Connecticut, and the instructor pilot who survived the crash said it was intentional. Family and friends of Freitekh are already writing about him on Facebook with oodles of praises from  good man   hero  to  Allah be with him  in Arabic. Click and check it out for yourself. Rafeek Zabian comments  Our old friend, Feras Freitekh, is with Allah, after he fulfilled his dream to fly, he died as a pilot, yes, and he accomplished his dream, may Allah be with you .Here are pictures from the Facebook page of in what appears to be Mecca. The pictures appear to be very recent, as they are dated June 3, 2016. People see him kissing the tip of the propeller and they do not think. The kiss is a kiss for the tip of his missile he is using. He and the Muslims and relatives commenting know why he came to the U.S. The argument with the co-pilot that he  does not want to fly anymore  is an excuse to land early because his intention is likely to swerve at the US defense contractor facility. It would take hours to include all the other praises from folks who would seem normal to the naked eye, yet they harbor ill for the United States.What is alarming about this crash is that the crash occurred near Pratt & Whitney, a defense contractor that makes jet engines for the military. Pratt & Whitney is a major defense contractor which manufactures military and commercial jet engines. East Hartford Police Chief called the company s plant  critical infrastructure,  the Hartford Courant reports. Police said the FBI was contacted because of the proximity to Pratt & Whitney.A high-ranking law enforcement source told the Hartford Courant there was an argument between the student pilot and the instructor prior to the crash.  Terrorism is a criminal act,  East Hartford Police spokesman Lieutenant Joshua Litwin said at a press conference.  There is a lot of criminal investigators on scene. Nothing has been ruled out. The surviving flight instructor, identified by the Courant as Arian Prevalla, was able to get out of the plane after the crash and is expected to survive. Freitekh came to the United States from Jordan in 2012 on a temporary M-1 visa for flight school. The FBI and local police raided an apartment on Annawan Street as part of the investigation, WVIT-TV reports. Neighbors told WTIC-TV that four men lived together in the apartment targeted by police. Sources told the Hartford Courant the three other men who lived there were also foreign nationals studying to become pilots. And don t be fooled, the pilot, Feras M. Freitekh also has another Facebook as Rafael Majdi Freitekh and he is gay with all the rainbow flags. He was not a  peaceful Muslim  and neither was he a  peaceful gay  after all, as society tries to arm-twist us to believe about Muslims and gays. He stops writing anything on his timeline for a year is perhaps the man decided to go dark becoming a lone-wolf.The instructor pilot who survived the crash was hospitalized with serious burns, CBS News reports. He was identified as Adrian Prevalla by the Hartford Courant. Officials say he is cooperating with the investigation. He runs the Hartford Jet Center, according to his Linkedin profile. The flight school is based at Hartford-Brainard Airport, where the plane took off from on Tuesday.Via: Shoebat",politics,"Oct 12, 2016",1
2433,Massachusetts governor signs bill hiking tax on recreational pot,"Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker on Friday signed a bill raising the tax on retail sales of recreational marijuana to 20 percent, up from the 12 percent rate proposed in a successful 2016 ballot initiative. The state is one of eight in the United States to have legalized use of the drug by adults 21 and older. Marijuana possession was legalized on Dec. 15, 2016, but retail sales of the drug remain illegal until Jan. 1, 2018, a delay intended to give state and local authorities time to decide how to regulate the trade. Baker, a Republican, opposed legalization as did several senior state officials, and he voiced concern about the future after signing the law. “I don’t support this. I worry terribly about what the consequences will be,” Baker told reporters. “We appreciate the careful consideration the legislature took to balance input from lawmakers, educators, public safety officials and public health professionals, while honoring the will of the voters regarding the adult use of marijuana.” The law also allows cities and towns to ban or limit marijuana sales and creates a five-member Cannabis Control Commission with responsibility for overseeing the sale of recreational and medical marijuana. The measure approved by voters called for legal retail sales of the drug to begin on July 1, but state legislators pushed that date back by six months to allow time to develop regulations. Legalization backers, who had protested the delay, called on state officials to move quickly in appointing the new control commission. “The state will benefit greatly from the tax revenues and jobs created by the new industry, and we are confident lawmakers will secure appropriate funding to get the regulatory system up and running on the current timeline,” said Jim Borghesani, a spokesman for Regulate Mass, which supported the ballot initiative.",politicsNews,"July 28, 2017 ",1
21275,EU urges swifter Brexit talks as London seeks 'flexibility',"The European Union s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Monday he was concerned at the slow progress of Brexit talks, while his British counterpart David Davis called for  imagination and flexibility  to move on.  British officials arrived in Brussels on Monday hoping to push the EU toward talks about their post-Brexit ties, which the bloc refuses to launch until there is agreement on London s exit bill and other pressing  divorce  matters, including the rights of EU citizens in Britain after March 2019.  To be honest, I am concerned. Time passes quickly,  Barnier told reporters as he welcomed Davis back for a new round of talks. The third formal session since the process began in June, it is due to wind up on Thursday.  We must start negotiating seriously,  Barnier said.  The sooner we remove the ambiguity, the sooner we will be in a position to discuss the future relationship.  He welcomed a series of proposals London made over the summer break, but made clear they fell short of what EU leaders want to see before they will agree to open negotiations on the future free trade agreement the British government wants. Impatient with the structure of talks agreed among the 27 other states and now binding Barnier s negotiators, the British position papers made frequent reference to a future relationship with the EU rather than just the immediate task of bringing legal clarity for people and business when Britain leaves.  The UK government has published a large number of papers covering important issues related to our withdrawal and our vision for a deep and special partnership,  Davis said.  We want to lock in the points where we agree, unpick the areas where we disagree and make further progress on the whole range of issues,  he added. To do that would require  flexibility and imagination from both sides , he said. But the EU wants to settle the major separation issues of ensuring expatriate rights, agreeing a divorce bill and squaring the circle of the future Irish border before jumping into talks about post-Brexit ties with London.  The EU 27 and the European Parliament are united. They will not accept that separation issues are not addressed properly,  Barnier said.  I am ready to intensify negotiations over the coming weeks in order to advance.  British officials took a relaxed view of Barnier s implied criticisms, noting it was a familiar line from the former French minister, and dismissed a suggestion talks were going badly. The EU has already signaled that the slow progress so far has made talks about a new accord with Britain less likely to start after an EU summit in October, as had been hoped. The EU and Britain seem far apart on agreeing how much London should pay the bloc on departure to account for previous commitments.  The Irish issue is extremely delicate because of the history of political violence there, as well as the complex economic consequences of Brexit.  Dublin said on Monday much of the future border arrangements between Northern Ireland and Ireland could be solved before Brexit talks enter the next phase. Neither side expects major breakthroughs this week in talks aimed at unraveling more than 40 years of union. Neither seems ready for major political concessions at this stage. An EU official said it was  clearly worrying that we have major differences of core issues ... with very little time to land all this, even if Britain moves . Britain s opposition Labour Party on Sunday offered an alternative to the policy pursued by Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May by saying it would stay in the European single market for a transitional period after Brexit. The British and German chambers of commerce together urged negotiators on Monday to start talks about future trading relations, and particularly customs arrangements, swiftly. Writing in Le Monde in his native France, Barnier said the EU and Britain must remain allies for their common defense:  The Union of 27 and the United Kingdom will have to join forces to stand up to common threats,  he said.   The security of our citizens cannot be haggled over.",worldnews,"August 27, 2017 ",0

5567,Canada foreign minister will oppose U.S. border tariffs,"Canada opposes the idea of the United States imposing new border tariffs and would respond to any such move, the country’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said on Wednesday after her first meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Tillerson’s meeting with Freeland, and a separate meeting with Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, at the State Department touched on the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement, which President Donald Trump wants to renegotiate. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Freeland said she made clear in the meeting with Tillerson that Canada would oppose the idea of border tariffs on Canadian goods in upcoming NAFTA talks. “If such an idea were ever to come into being, Canada would respond appropriately,” she told reporters on a conference call, stressing that Ottawa did not yet know what the U.S. opening position would be. Both Canada and Mexico send the bulk of their exports to the United States and could be crippled by major changes to NAFTA, which Trump has called “a disaster.” Mexico’s Foreign Ministry said that Videgaray discussed migration and security issues in his meetings with Tillerson and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly. Both Tillerson and Videgaray said they would keep working on solutions to their public “differences,” it added. Videgaray also told Kelly that the human rights of Mexicans in the United States was important, the statement said. After their hour-long meeting, Videgaray told reporters that Tillerson had said he would visit Mexico in the coming weeks, according to a Mexican Foreign Ministry official. The State Department did not provide a readout of either of the meetings, which occurred in Tillerson’s first full week in his new post.   Trump made free trade deals a major target during his campaign for the presidency. He says NAFTA, formally signed in 1994, has harmed American workers. The pact was aimed at removing tariff barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States. Canada is trying to persuade the new administration and senior politicians that its especially close ties with the United States mean the country should be spared protectionist measures. “In making the case for how balanced and mutually beneficial our economic relationship was, I really felt I was pushing on an open door with everyone I spoke to,” Freeland said.",politicsNews,"February 8, 2017 ",0
21927,Bundy Case Ruled a Mistrial – Will Federal Case Soon Crumble?,"Mark Anderson  21st Century WireThe Greek philosopher Plato was credited with saying,  Justice in the life and conduct of the State is possible only as first it resides in the hearts and souls of the citizens. Well, since longtime Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, his sons, and his other compatriots have demonstrated they possess a strong sense of principles and justice, perhaps a little justice in the life of the American state is possible which is no small thing in an age of nearly universal tyranny and injustice.This welcome ray of light became apparent in Las Vegas on Dec. 20 when U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro declared a mistrial in the current high-profile proceedings involving Cliven, his sons Ryan and Ammon, and Ryan Payne.This prompted members of the Bundy family and dozens of their supporters to leave the courthouse on that Tuesday in a state of elation, even with the presence of protesters who, holding signs that read,  Keep your Bundy hands off public lands,  appeared to be paid agitators for billionaire leftist revolutionary George Soros, as one protestor basically admitted.Back in the spring of 2014, the above-named four defendants who ve become emblematic of the plight of Western ranchers resisting heavy-handed federal land controls were accompanied by other Bundy siblings, and by scores of supporters from across the nation, all of whom gathered near Cliven s ranch in Clark County, in southern Nevada, to exercise their First and Second Amendment rights.On that basis, these brave souls, some of whom were armed in an open-carry state, protested the actions of well-armed Bureau of Land Management agents, FBI agents (including SWAT units) and contractors, when these officials showed up, set up shop, and finally moved to impound Cliven s cattle over flimsy allegations of unpaid grazing fees on public lands. The impoundment attempt, on April 12, 2014, was unsuccessful, however.But while the government retreated that day after a lengthy and often tense standoff, a 16-count federal indictment was eventually handed down. Cliven, Ammon and the two Ryans were among nearly 20 initially indicted in this now-legendary federal case, which hasn t gone particularly well for prosecutors ever since the first of several planned trials started in February of 2017.Thus, the government, despite spending millions of dollars, has seen its case steadily deflate to the point where, as of now, the only things that remain, according to a legal observer, are for Judge Navarro to receive briefs from the prosecution and the defense by 5 p.m. Dec. 29 (when a hearing may take place). Those briefs will consist of arguments to enable the judge to decide whether or not to fully dismiss the case.The mistrial happened around 9:30 a.m. Pacific Time Dec. 20, as  Navarro told the jury to  go home . . . it s over,  recounted Roger Roots, a legal expert and author who has observed virtually every trial proceeding firsthand.He said that after Judge Navarro reviews the briefs, an open hearing will be convened at 9 a.m. on Jan. 8, according to the court schedule as of this writing. If she rules for dismissal Jan. 8  without prejudice,  the indictment remains in force and federal prosecutors technically could reset the trial of Cliven and the three others, reportedly on or around Feb. 26. But if she rules for dismissal  with prejudice,  then the indictment is dissolved, according to Roots.Roots said a dissolved indictment would mean the government would have to go to the trouble and expense of convening a new grand jury in order to seek a new indictment which would be  double jeopardy  and therefore a probable constitutional violation.And while Roots said the government conceivably could appeal the mistrial ruling to the Ninth Circuit, at this point he does not believe the government would jump through all the necessary hoops for a new indictment.Notably, what helped make the mistrial a reality was Navarro s findings (reached during hearings on exculpatory evidence that the government has been withholding) that the prosecution had committed several Brady v Maryland violations including not disclosing to the defense the existence of surveillance cameras, including those trained at the Bundy homestead.Also included is not disclosing the fact that concealed snipers were stationed around the area at the time of the 2014 standoff; not disclosing the existence of maps of the snipers  positions; and, among other things, not disclosing threat-assessment reports which include government admissions that Cliven and company are not dangerous people.SEE ALSO: Nevada Residents:  Public Land Belongs to the People, Not DC Notably, family patriarch Cliven, as a matter of principle, stayed in prison despite a recent hearing in which the court allowed him to leave jail under house arrest. He has been jailed since early 2016 and has suffered from health problems.Cliven based his decision on the fact that a few remaining defendants which had included his sons Mel and Dave until they, too, were granted house arrest are still in jail awaiting a final trial that s been scheduled to take place sometime next year. Moreover, Ryan and Ammon Bundy, as well as Ryan Payne, all were recently released under house-arrest rulings, after an equally grueling amount of time behind bars.During a recent on-the-air interview, Cliven s daughter-in-law Briana, who s Mel s wife, told Free Speech Zone host Jim Lambley of KSDZ-FM  The Twister  out of Nebraska that in the almost two years that Cliven has been behind bars, several more grandchildren of his were born. Yet Cliven, despite such a strong emotional attachment to his large family, still chose to remain in jail to honor the others still imprisoned.On a Dec. 20 appearance on the same radio show, Briana added,  Over 3,300 hundred pages of evidence that could ve helped the defense have been withheld and have been turned over to the defense in the last two weeks . . . . It was absolutely intentional and she [Judge Navarro] said she believes it was intentional because of what they withheld. Briana, who understands that even one, let alone several Brady violations, normally would be expected to lead to a full dismissal of the case right away (rather than carrying on with more hearings) added, however, that the Bundy siblings all are wearing electronic ankle bracelets and cannot leave their house-arrest locations before 7 a.m. and must return by 7 p.m., even while they are prohibited from congregating during Christmastime. But we re still winning here,  Briana went on to tell KSDZ host Jim Lambley, while adding that even though a dismissal was hoped-for, rather than a mistrial, the upside is that any further proceedings will provide an opportunity to expose even more evidence that the government has withheld.Lambley replied:  The government is just digging a deeper hole for themselves; the government is the false accuser here, that s all there is to it.

7787,"North Carolina police probe arson, graffiti threat at Republican office","SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Police in North Carolina sought leads on Monday about a fire they believe was deliberately set at a local Republican headquarters over the weekend and a graffiti message warning the political party to “leave town or else.” Investigators are treating the incident as arson. The fire caused heavy damage to the Orange County Republican Party’s office in Hillsborough, North Carolina, about 40 miles (65 km) from the state capital of Raleigh.  “This is political terrorism,” said Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party.  Both Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton condemned the attack. North Carolina is considered a battleground state that could play a pivotal role in the Nov. 8 presidential contest. “We are taking this incident very seriously and have significant resources at the local, state and federal level committed to this investigation,” Hillsborough Police Chief Duane Hampton said in a statement on Monday, asking anyone with information to come forward. Hillsborough police said a bottle containing flammable material ignited after being thrown through a front window of the headquarters between midnight and about 9 a.m. on Sunday, when a nearby business owner reported the crime. “Someone has firebombed through the window (of) the Republican party up here beside me and sprayed all over the side of my building, ‘Nazi Republicans leave town or else,’” the caller told a 911 operator in a call released on Monday. A swastika also was spray-painted on the neighboring building, police said. They said no one was in the party office at the time, but the substance burned furniture and charred campaign signs. White House spokesman Josh Earnest praised the efforts of self-described Democrats who raised about $13,000 in an online GoFundMe campaign to help Republicans reopen the office. “That’s consistent with the values that we lift up in this country,” he said at a news briefing. “There is no justification for the use of violence to advance a political agenda.” In a tweet on Sunday, Clinton said she was grateful no one was hurt in the attack, which she called “horrific and unacceptable.” Trump blamed his Democratic opponent’s supporters for the crime. “Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning,” he said on Twitter. Registered Democrats far outnumber Republicans in Orange County, according to elections board data.  Republicans said the incident took them by surprise but left them undeterred as they started clean-up efforts at their strip-mall headquarters and worked in a bus being used as a temporary mobile office.  “We’re not going to be intimated; we’re not going to be cowed,” Woodhouse said.  On Monday, the Arizona Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix was evacuated for about two hours after a bomb threat was left by phone. Police said nothing was found during a search of the premises.  Party officials said the call was received from an adult male at about 3:15 p.m. local time saying there was a bomb in the building and for occupants to get out.",politicsNews,"October 17, 2016 ",0

13544,"SANCTIMONIOUS, OPEN-BORDERS PAUL RYAN Is Tanking In Polls…Will FED UP Voters Avenge Non-Trump Supporters In November?","Will Republican voters take down sanctimonious RINO s like Speaker Ryan when they hit the voting booths for Trump in 2016? Paul Ryan s reluctance to get behind Trump and support his bid for President may actually hurt his chances of re-election in November. Ryan s arrogance and lack of interest in supporting the very popular Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump may cause him to lose a large number of voters who were previously behind him. A poll of likely Republican voters shows House Speaker Paul Ryan well below 50 percent in his race to maintain his seat in Wisconsin s first Congressional district. The poll was conducted by P.M.I., with 424 respondents randomly called from a file of 11,000 likely GOP primary voters. It shows that with one month remaining before Wisconsin s August 9th vote, Ryan is polling at 43 percent.Ryan s challenger, Wisconsin businessman Paul Nehlen, is polling at 32 percent.The Nehlen campaign notes that Ryan s 43 percent  represents a drop of more than 30 points since the Nehlen campaign began polling likely Republican primary voters earlier in the year. This poll shows voters are considering their options and choosing to opt out of Paul Ryan s job-killing policies,  Nehlen said.The new poll could be viewed as a warning sign to Ryan, as Wisconsin voters may be growing increasingly frustrated with the key elements of Ryan s longstanding policy agenda.Nehlen told Breitbart that the reason Ryan has tanked below 50 percent in the latest poll is a direct result of his policies on trade, immigration, and national sovereignty. Paul Ryan is the most open borders, pro-Wall Street, anti-worker member of Congress in either party,  Paul Nehlen said during a Saturday press conference, which was held in front of Ryan s border wall surrounding his Janesville mansion.  Everything that Americans despise about their government, Paul Ryan represents  Can you name one time when Paul Ryan fought as hard for you and your family as he s fought for corporate America?  Nehlen asked.In recent weeks, Nehlen has launched an aggressive billboard campaign that has thrown a spotlight on Ryan s longstanding support for open borders immigration policies that would flood the labor market, as well as trade policies that ship American jobs overseas.On immigration, Ryan has a two-decade long history of pushing open borders policies. Dating back to his time as a Congressional staffer in the mid-90s, Ryan worked to derail the bipartisan immigration curbs inspired by Civil Rights leader and late-Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.In 2013, Ryan worked hand in hand with Luis Gutierrez to push Marco Rubio s border-opening immigration agenda.For years, Ryan has been vocal about his desire to enact open borders. Every month the U.S. imports a population of immigrants that is larger than the occupancy of Lambeau Field. Yet Ryan has repeatedly pushed policies that would make that number even larger despite the fact that 92% of the GOP electorate, and 83% of the American electorate in general, want to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.Just last year, Ryan s omnibus spending bill funded a controversial expansion of the refugee resettlement program funding visas for nearly 300,000 (temporary and permanent) Muslim migrants within the course of a single year.Despite the fact that seven in ten GOP Wisconsin voters support Donald Trump s proposal to enact a temporary pause on Muslim migration, Ryan has ruled out curbing Muslim migration into the United States insisting  that s not who we are. Every year the U.S. issues visas to a population of temporary and permanent Muslim migrants that is larger in size than the number of Paul Ryan voters in Wisconsin s first Congressional district.On trade, Ryan has been one of Congress  leading advocates for globalist policies that have impacted American jobs.Since Ryan took office in 1999, Wisconsin has lost one-fifth of its total manufacturing jobs.Yet in 2015, Ryan acted as President Obama s  partner  in his effort to fast track the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). In a 2015 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Ryan described the TPP as a  historic  agreement, which  would mean greater access to a billion customers for American manufacturers, farmers, and ranchers. Wisconsin suffered a net loss of nearly 40,000 jobs in 2015 alone due to the U.S. trade deficit with TPP countries, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Wisconsin exit polls showed that a majority of Wisconsin GOP voters (54%) believe that foreign trade kills jobs.Moreover, in recent months, Ryan has taken a series of actions that seem designed to undermine his own party s 2016 presidential aspirations and further the candidacy Hillary Clinton.Ryan dragged out his decision to endorse Donald Trump for weeks leaving voters with the distinct impression that Ryan does not consider the choice between Trump versus Clinton to be an easy one.Although Ryan has now technically endorsed Trump, he continues to be one of Trump s most frequent public critics. In interviews about the election, Ryan seems much more aggressive in attacking Trump than he has been in going after Hillary Clinton.In this sense, some argue that Ryan has perhaps done more damage to Trump with his endorsement than he could have done by not endorsing him much the same way that Rick Santorum helped tank Marco Rubio by giving one of the worst endorsement interviews in history, in which he could not name a single accomplishment of Sen. Rubio.Nehlen s spokesman said that in light of the growing momentum in the district, the campaign is planning to substantially increase its expenditures. Nehlen s spokesman, Eric Odom, said:The Nehlen camp is running a full campaign operation with more than 1,000 doors being knocked each day, targeted mail dropping into homes, billboards up all over the district, aggressive sign marketing, TV and radio ads blanketing the district and mobile marketing reaching voters in ways that are making a significant impact. This effort is presenting profound influence in the district and voters are liking what they see. This poll, and the momentum that comes with it, has us ready to increase expenditures and step up our fight in a big way.For entire story: Breitbart",politics,"Jul 10, 2016",1
3829,One HUGE Way Liberals Are Already Fighting Back Against Trump,"While they are sad and in understandable despair, liberals are not simply sitting shell-shocked over the election of Donald Trump to the presidency. Very aware of the danger the newly elected Republican government will mean for vulnerable citizens, liberals are rushing to the defense of key organizations that have been targeted by Republicans.Few groups have been the subject of Republican and conservative attacks like Planned Parenthood has, and now liberals are letting them know they ve got their backs.Since the election, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said it has received nearly 80,000 new donations nationwide, although it did not disclose the money amount.Planned Parenthood of Illinois said online appointments for long-acting contraceptives like IUDs, or intrauterine devices, rose nearly 50 percent in the past two days compared to the same period last week. It said it plans to increase the number of available appointments to meet demand. We have been overwhelmed by community members making donations and contacting us to offer to volunteer and provide support,  said Sarah Wheat, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas, where successive Republican governors have cut funding to the organization.Republicans have gone after Planned Parenthood because they provide birth control and abortion access to women, regardless of income. The right has gone after them with hoax videos designed to implicate the group in criminal acts, brought its leaders before congress in order to berate them without cause, and voted over and over and over to cut federal funding.President Obama and congressional Democrats have repeatedly pushed back against the Republican onslaught, but many of the measures they have put in place have been weakened by sustained Republican obstruction over the last eight years. Many of these protections can be undone by a Trump presidency, and while Trump himself has not strongly pushed on the abortion issue, many Republicans will be looking to him in to attack women s health.Featured image via Flickr",News,"November 12, 2016",0

Fallon s tribute? A song called,  I ve Got Friends On All Bases,  which he and Adam Sandler sang to an audience full of service men and women from all five branches of the military.Fallon began the song with: Well I ll tell you the truth, I love all the troops, protectin  the land, sea and air. Sandler chimed in with: Now you re back in town, keepin  us safe and sound, from that crazy-ass Elmo in Times Square. They both sang that they have friends  from the Navy, up to the Air Force Aces; the Army Greens, Coast Guard and Marines,  being absolutely certain to include everyone in their comedic piece of music. It s especially fitting since we still have lots of troops in the Middle East, and may send a lot more there (and everywhere else) if Donald Trump gets elected in November.But while the song itself was amusing (to say the least), it was the troops  reaction to the song that was the real treat of the evening.

7577,WATCH: Insider Reveals How Trump University Scammed People,"A former employee of Donald Trump s Trump University has become the star of a new campaign ad in which he testifies to some of the shady business practices used by the current Republican frontrunner s enterprise. Cliff  appears in a new ad from the conservative American Future Fund. He identifies himself as a former salesman for Trump University, and tells viewers,  with Donald Trump, you always have to read the fine print. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9Gr9nS3fLk&feature=youtu.beIn the ad, Cliff explains how he was enlisted to cold call people who had attended the seminars held in hotel rooms across the country by Trump University and would take them  on an emotional rollercoaster  in order to sell them on more and more product, sales which would soon find their ways into the pockets of Trump.Cliff also reveals that the  mentors  who were supposed to teach Trump University patrons how to make money in real estate were  not as qualified  as they were supposed to be, which resulted in disappointment for customers.According to the whistleblower, the Trump University had  non-stop calls  with complaints from people about the inadequate training and guidance they had received, even though ads for Trump University promised access to a world of wealth similar to what Trump has sold for years.American Future Fund said in a press release that the ad would be part of a  seven-figure Florida ad buy,  in part of the ongoing attempt by the Republican establishment to deny giving Trump the Republican presidential nomination. Despite the expensive advertising commitment, the most recent polling shows Trump is positioned to win the primary in the winner-take-all state, as he is currently leading Senator Marco Rubio by 7 percent, even though it is Rubio s home state.Trump has claimed that even though Trump University was labeled a  bait-and-switch  scheme by the New York State Attorney General, he and the company that operated it did nothing wrong. Trump even said that should he be elected president, he had plans to resurrect the now-defunct company with his children running it.Featured image via YouTube",News,"March 10, 2016",0
979,Fox News Says ‘Health Insurance Doesn’t Matter Cause We’re All Going To Die Anyway’,"Figuring out the best way to deal with healthcare and health insurance is very delicate, complicated. We ve got hundreds of thousands of Americans to take care of.Or do we? We re all going to die anyway. At least, according to Fox News.Fox News has presented the best argument to the health insurance problem on Wednesday by revealing that we will all one day die so it doesn t matter. We can all pack up and go home   everything is solved. You know what the crazy thing is?  Lisa Kennedy Montgomery said to her fellow hosts, chuckling after each soundbite from the Democrats.  We re all gonna die. And they can t predict there, there s no way, unless they re absolutely psychic and have a party line to heaven, they don t know who is going to die, or when, or how many people! This revelation and chuckling came after airing statements from Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, in which they warn that cutting health care access for at least 22 million people by 2026 a figure the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released this week   could result in thousands of deaths across the nation.I guess when you get down to it, the genius of this argument is pretty funny. It s so simple!Newsweek points out that multiple studies over the course of decades have consistently reflected a decrease in deaths from treatable diseases when there is increased access to coverage. A New England Journal of Medicine report states  the largest decreases [in death rates] were for deaths from  health care amenable  conditions such as heart disease, infections and cancer, which are more plausibly affected by access to medical care. Beginning with the Institute of Medicine s 2002 report  Care Without Coverage,  some analyses have suggested that lack of insurance causes tens of thousands of deaths each year in the United States,  the journal wrote in its report,  Health Insurance Coverage and Health What the Recent Evidence Tells Us. Several quasi experimental studies using population-level data and longer follow-up offer more precise estimates of coverage s effect on mortality,  it continues.  One study compared three states implementing large Medicaid expansions in the early 2000s to neighboring states that didn t expand Medicaid, finding a significant 6 percent decrease in mortality over five years of follow-up. Source: NewsweekIn other words, the personalities on Fox News are completely lost. Do people genuinely watch Fox News? Do they really soak all this in? There s enough evidence to show that cutting medical coverage will seriously hurt thousands of people, yet Fox News is happy to laugh it off.Featured image via Robin Marchant/Getty Images",News,"June 29, 2017",1

Mike Huckabee was the first to fall, joking that it wasn t due to low votes but to illness.  The voters are sick of me,  said the Huckster. Waka waka. Buh bye. Rand Paul went down in flames shortly thereafter, deciding to make sure he doesn t lose his senate seat instead, which is a valid concern.For the Democrats, Martin O malley dropped out, which comes as no surprise to anyone.That leaves the two major contenders for the Democrats and a still ridiculously large field of horrible governors, senators who don t bother voting and a few non-politician types who don t understand the first thing about how the real world works.Even with the dropouts and a Cruz victory proving devastating to Donald Trump, the real loser of the Iowa caucuses was Jeb Bush, who outspent every by dropping more than $12 million and walking away with votes in the single digits. None of the  establishment  favorites fared well with the exception of Marco Rubio, who stepped up in the absence of Donald Trump at the last Fox News debate and screamed at America every time he was given the chance.It s a circus for sure.

10121,"Senator concerned over U.N., Iran missiles and nuclear pact","The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee said on Wednesday the U.N. Security Council’s refusal to respond to Iran’s ballistic missile tests defied Obama administration assurances that a ban on such tests would remain in place after the Iran nuclear deal. “As many of us feared, now it appears Iran can defy those restrictions with impunity fearing no pushback from the U.N. Security Council,” Republican Senator Bob Corker said, in response to a report by Reuters that diplomats suggested Iran’s tests do not technically violate provisions of Security Council Resolution 2231. Corker authored legislation giving the U.S. Congress the right to review the international nuclear deal announced in July and joined other members of his party in opposing it. Many U.S. lawmakers have demanded more sanctions over the missile tests. Council diplomats told Reuters on Wednesday experts from the 15-nation body would discuss Iran’s missile work on Friday. They are expected to consider the possibility of a council statement condemning the missile program, the diplomats said.  Iran’s recent ballistic tests involved missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and were “inconsistent with” and “in defiance of” council resolution 2231, adopted in July, the United States, Britain, France and Germany said in a joint letter to Spanish U.N. Ambassador Roman Oyarzun Marchesi and U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon. Spain has been assigned the task of coordinating council discussions on resolution 2231. The letter said missiles used in the recent launches were “inherently capable of delivering nuclear weapons.” It also asked that the Security Council discuss “appropriate responses” to Tehran’s failure to comply with its obligations and urged Ban to report back on Iranian missile work inconsistent with 2231. The letter stopped short of calling the Iranian launches a “violation” of the resolution, which “calls upon” Iran to refrain for up to eight years from activity, including launches, related to ballistic missiles designed with the capability of delivering nuclear weapons. Security Council diplomats have said the case for new U.N. sanctions was weak, hinging on interpretation of ambiguous language in a resolution adopted as part of a July nuclear deal to drastically restrict Iran’s nuclear work. Russia, a veto-wielding permanent member, has made clear it considers compliance with the appeal in resolution 2231 to be voluntary. Tehran has also said it is under no obligation to comply with the appeal to refrain from missile work and vowed to continue developing ballistic missiles.",politicsNews,"March 30, 2016 ",0

Trump has repeatedly stood by Flynn, so claiming he wanted Bannon to watch him means he knew Flynn was a crook but put him in the job anyways. Not a good look.What s the real reason Bannon was slapped down? A source close to Trump told White House correspondent John Roberts that Trump had grown increasingly jealous of Bannon sharing his  limelight. We are also told, though, that the president wasn t particularly happy with the way Bannon had been grabbing the limelight and that may have also played into all of this. The other, other shoe drops. @johnrobertsFox:  The president wasn t particularly happy at the way Bannon had been grabbing the limelight  pic.twitter.com/P3PIXNwL0n  Tom Namako (@TomNamako) April 5, 2017Which is kind of like life imitating art because for months people have been noting that the best (and perhaps only) way to stop severely unqualified Bannon from having influence in the White House would be to appeal to Trump s massive ego.Memo to all magazine editors: Put Bannon on the cover with big headlines referring to him as ""The Real President."" https://t.co/tMHXB5ZpVN  Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet) February 7, 2017And Politico reported in February that Trump was already furious that Bannon was getting some of the credit for his administration s actions. It s an issue that s been nagging at him for months.Hilariously, Saturday Night Live seized upon this unique opportunity to piss off Trump by referring to a grim reaper clothed Bannon as  President Bannon,  playing up the fact that Trump wasn t really in charge.Apparently, this childish play on Trump s narcissism actually worked. Trump would never go after Bannon because he s unqualified and overtly racist, or that he once described himself as Satan and Darth Vader. But Trump would certainly go after Bannon for getting too much attention. And he just did.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"April 5, 2017",0

12829,Zimbabwe judge frees ousted finance minister on bail,"A Zimbabwean judge freed ousted finance minister Ignatius Chombo on bail on Thursday in a ruling that underlined judicial independence just three weeks after the army helped depose Robert Mugabe. Chombo, a senior member of the  G40  faction of the ruling party that was targeted in the military s Nov. 15 intervention, was dragged from his home in the middle of the night and held incommunicado by soldiers at an undisclosed location for a week. During that time he was beaten, according to his lawyer. He was arrested by police on his release and charged with fraud and abuse of office relating to his time as a government minister over a decade ago. The Harare magistrate s court denied him bail. However, High Court judge Edith Mushore condemned that ruling as  littered with mis-directions  and  wading into the muddy court of public opinion  after the massive army-backed protests that helped topple Mugabe after 37 years in power. Chombo, 65, was ordered to be released on $5,000 bail, surrender his passport and the title deeds of his Harare mansion and report to a police station in the capital three times a day. The tone and substance of Mushore s ruling also sent a stern message to the army-backed administration of President Emmerson Mnangagwa about the independence of the courts and the primacy of the law, aspects of public life often ignored by Mugabe. During his detention by the military, Chombo had been denied basic rights enshrined in the constitution such as access to justice and presumption of innocence, Mushore said. In particular, she said Zimbabweans needed to know they  can sleep at night  without the fear of arbitrary detention in secret locations beyond the reach of lawyers or family - a common feature of the police state run by Mugabe.  The public in Zimbabwe needs to know that they have a right to access to justice,  she said. Chombo was one of several G40 figures detained during the military s  Operation Restore Legacy  that was officially launched to remove  criminals  around Mugabe. Most Zimbabweans interpreted this as meaning Mugabe s 52-year-old wife Grace, who was positioning herself as a successor to her 93-year-old husband at the expense of Mnangagwa, who was purged from the ruling party in early November. Chombo s lawyer says he will deny the charges when his trial starts. In a cursory analysis, Mushore characterized the state s case against him as  mere allegation .",worldnews,"December 7, 2017 ",1
4814,IRS Slams Trump Foundation For Breaking The Law,"The Donald J. Trump Foundation just quietly paid an IRS fine for breaking the law. Trump paid the IRS a $2,500 fine after the Washington Post exposed that his foundation had broken the law by giving a political foundation to a group connected to Florida attorney general Pam Bondi.The improper donation, a $25,000 gift from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, was made in 2013. At the time, Attorney General Pam Bondi was considering whether to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University. She decided not to pursue the case.Bondi s decision to let Trump University skate despite allegations of wrongdoing after the Trump donation has caused considerable controversy, with some demanding an investigation into possible corruption by the Republican attorney general.The Washington Post found that Trump didn t notify the IRS about his donation and it was recorded as a donation to a completely different organization.In that year s tax filings, The Post reported, The Trump Foundation did not notify the IRS of this political donation. Instead, Trump s foundation listed a donation   also for $25,000   to a Kansas charity with a name similar to that of Bondi s political group. In fact, Trump s foundation had not given the Kansas group any money at all.The prohibited gift was, in effect, replaced with an innocent-sounding but nonexistent donation.Trump claims that the misfiled donation was simply a mistake, but it fits into a pattern of Trump and his organization and so-called charities moving money around in a dubious fashion. An investigation by the same newspaper has tried to verify Trump s wild claims of charitable donations, but has so far been completely unable to do so.Earlier this year, Trump had failed to donate to veteran s charities, despite his promise to do so months ago. He only finally gave in and gave money to veterans after the news reports surfaced and politicians like Hillary Clinton attacked him for stiffing the organization.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 1, 2016",0

19160,"Kurds stick with independence vote, 'never going back to Baghdad': Barzani","Iraq s Kurds will go ahead with a referendum on independence on Monday because their partnership with Baghdad has failed, Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani said on Sunday, shrugging off international opposition to the vote. In response, the Iraqi government asked the autonomous Kurdish region to hand over control of its international border posts, its international airports and called on foreign countries to stop importing Kurdish crude oil. It asked  the neighboring countries and the countries of the world to deal exclusively with the federal government of Iraq in regards to entry posts and oil,   according to a statement from Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi s office. The United States and other Western powers have urged Kurdish authorities in the oil producing region to cancel the vote, arguing that it distracts from the fight against Islamic State. Turkey and Iran have also kept up the pressure to stop the vote, with presidents Tayyip Erdogan and Hassan Rouhani speaking by phone and expressing concern that it will  bring chaos in the region , according to Erdogan s office. Barzani, at a news conference at his headquarters near Erbil, dismissed the worries of Iraq s neighbors, committing to respect laws on international boundaries and not seek to redraw the region s borders.  We will never go back to the failed partnership  with Baghdad, he said, adding Iraq had become a  theocratic, sectarian state  and not the democratic one that was supposed to be built after the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein. The vote, expected to result in a comfortable  yes  to  independence, is not binding and is meant to give the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) a mandate to negotiate secession with Baghdad and the neighboring countries. Barzani said Iraq s Kurds would seek talks with the Shi ite-led central government to implement the expected  yes  outcome, even if they take two years or more, to settle land and oil sharing disputes ahead of independence. Abadi s government in Iraq regards the referendum as anti-constitutional and in a televised address on Sunday he said it  could lead to ethnic divisions, exposing (the Iraqis) to disastrous dangers that only God knows.  Earlier, Iranian authorities stopped air traffic to Iraqi Kurdistan s international airports at Erbil and Sulaimaniya in response to a request from Baghdad, Fars News Agency said.      Iran also started war games at the Kurdish border. Speaking by telephone with Abadi, Iran s Rouhani voiced support for Iraq s national unity and territorial integrity, the state news agency IRNA reported.  Iran fully supports Iraq s central government,  Rouhani was quoted as telling Abadi. On Saturday, Turkey s parliament voted to extend by a year a mandate authorizing the deployment of Turkish troops in Iraq and Syria. Turkey has also vowed political, economic and security steps without specifying what they are, but Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim reinforced the message on Sunday. Turkey is the transit route of all crude exported by the landlocked Kurdistan region of Iraq.  Turkey will never ever tolerate any status change or any new formations on its southern borders,  he said in a speech in the capital Ankara.  The KRG will be primarily responsible for the probable developments after this referendum.  But Barzani said Ankara  won t benefit  economically should it close the border with Iraqi Kurdistan.  Tehran and Ankara fear the spread of separatism to their own Kurds. Iran also supports Shi ite groups who have been ruling or holding key security and government positions in Iraq since the U.S-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein. Barzani said Kurds will  keep extending their hand  to Iran and Turkey, even if they do not reciprocate. He said he recently met in the Kurdish region Iranian Revolutionary Guard Commander Qassem Soleimani, who came to convince him to delay the vote. The KRG has resisted calls to delay the referendum by the United Nations, the United States and Britain who fear it could     lead to unrest in disputed areas like multi-ethnic oil-rich Kirkuk, as well as distracting from the war on Islamic State. But the Iraqi Kurds say the vote acknowledges their crucial contribution in confronting Islamic State after it overwhelmed the Iraqi army in 2014 and seized control of a third of Iraq. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters who control Kirkuk were given instructions not to respond to any provocation meant to disrupt the vote, but they will defend the region if attacked from outside, he said. The U.S. embassy in Iraq warned its citizens that there might be unrest during the referendum, especially in disputed areas like Kirkuk, also claimed by the Iraqi central government. The Iranian military drills, part of annual events held in Iran to mark the beginning of the 1980-1988 war with Iraq, were launched in the Oshnavieh border region, according to Iranian State broadcaster IRIB. Turkey s military said on Sunday its aircraft launched strikes against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) targets in northern Iraq s Gara region on Saturday after spotting militants preparing to attack Turkish military outposts on the border.",worldnews,"September 24, 2017 ",0
20724,Three policemen killed in Peru in drug-trafficking region: government,"Three Peruvian policemen were killed in an attack on patrol vehicles in a drug-trafficking region controlled by a remnant band of Shining Path rebels, the interior ministry said on Thursday. Authorities are investigating the attack, which occurred late on Wednesday in the jungle region known as the VRAEM, where most of Peru s cocaine is produced, the ministry said. The Maoist-inspired Shining Path largely ended its armed rebellion in the 1990s on orders from the group s leaders.  But a faction that refused to put down its weapons occasionally ambushes state security forces in the region, where rebels work with drug traffickers. So far this year, nine police or military officers have been killed in the VRAEM in a sign the Shining Path faction has regrouped after two top leaders were killed in 2013, said Peruvian security analyst Pedro Yaranga.  This is going to continue,  he said.

5238,Pentagon delivers draft plan to defeat Islamic State to White House,"A Pentagon-led preliminary plan to defeat Islamic State was delivered to the White House on Monday and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was expected to brief senior administration officials, a Defense Department spokesman told reporters. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters that it was the framework for a broader plan and looked at Islamic State around the world, not just Iraq and Syria. Davis said the plan would define what defeating Islamic State meant and was one that would “rapidly” defeat the militant group.  He added that Mattis would discuss the plan, which is primarily a written one with accompanying graphics, with members of the Cabinet-level Principals Committee. The review of U.S. strategy comes at a decisive moment in the U.S.-led coalition effort against Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria, and could lead to relaxing some of the former Obama administration’s policy restrictions, like limits on troop numbers. The Trump administration has said defeating “radical Islamic terror groups” is among its top foreign policy goals. The Baghdad-based U.S. commander on the ground, Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, has said he believes U.S.-backed forces would recapture both of Islamic State’s major strongholds - the cities of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria - within the next six months. Iraqi forces expect a fierce battle against Islamic State to retake Mosul. In Syria, the United States must soon decide whether to arm Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters, despite objections from NATO ally Turkey, which brands the militia group as terrorists. The U.S. military-led review includes input from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, as well as from the Treasury Department and the U.S. intelligence community. Davis said that in addition to diplomacy, the plan would include a military framework that builds on capabilities and goals on the battlefield. Experts have said the Pentagon could request additional forces, beyond the less than 6,000 American troops now deployed to both Iraq and Syria, helping the U.S. military go farther and do more in the fight. They also said the Pentagon may focus on smaller-scale options like increasing the number of attack helicopters and air strikes as well as bringing in more artillery. The military may also seek more authority to make battlefield decisions.",politicsNews,"February 27, 2017 ",1
19094,Austria's far right gives two cheers for German sister party's success,"Austria s anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO), seeking to soften its image before Austrians go to the polls next month, offered only lukewarm praise on Monday for a record election showing by its sister party in neighboring Germany. The Alternative for Germany (AfD), which says immigration threatens German culture, shocked the establishment by winning 12.6 percent in Sunday s national ballot, becoming the first far-right party to enter parliament in more than half a century. Its close Austrian equivalent, the FPO, has lost its lead in opinion polls to the conservative People s Party, led by 31-year-old Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, who has made a hard line on immigration one of his hallmarks.  But tensions between the conservatives and their coalition partners, the Social Democrats, before Austria s Oct. 15 parliamentary election mean the FPO has arguably its best chance of entering national government since its leader Heinz-Christian Strache took over the reins 12 years ago. Strache said on Monday the AfD s showing was  a huge success , but added a note of caution.   We agree (with the AfD) when it comes to analyzing the problems but not necessarily regarding the solutions. There are differences indeed,  Strache told broadcaster ORF, without elaborating.  The AfD is a very young party which is, if you like, still in its infancy.  The Freedom Party was founded in the 1950s by former Nazis, an aspect of its history the party argues is no longer relevant to its policies. It has positioned itself as staunchly anti-Islam but now courts Jewish voters, with apparently limited success. Strache has called anti-Semitism  a crime against humanity , but Austria s main Jewish group says the FPO is xenophobic and divisive. While the AfD also denies being a Nazi party, one of its leading candidates, Alexander Gauland, said this month that Germans should take pride in what their soldiers achieved during World Wars One and Two.    They (the FPO) are clearly setting themselves apart from Gauland s rhetoric,  political analyst Peter Hajek said of Strache s remarks. The AfD leadership cracked within hours of its electoral success on Monday when Frauke Petry, the highest-profile figure in its more moderate wing, stormed out of its victory news conference and abandoned its parliamentary group.",worldnews,"September 25, 2017 ",1
1530,"Trump administration red tape tangles up visas for skilled foreigners, data shows","The Trump administration is making it more difficult for skilled foreigners to work in the United States, challenging visa applications more often than at nearly any point in the Obama era, according to data reviewed by Reuters.     The more intense scrutiny of the applications for H-1B visas comes after President Donald Trump called for changes to the visa program so that it benefits the highest-paid workers, though he has not enacted any such reforms.  Data provided by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shows that between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, the agency issued 85,000 challenges, or “requests for evidence” (RFEs), to H-1B visa petitions - a 45 percent increase over the same period last year. The total number of H-1B petitions rose by less than 3 percent in the same period.  The challenges, which can slow down the issuance of visas by months, were issued at a greater rate in 2017 than at any time in the Obama administration except for one year, 2009, according to the USCIS data, which has not been previously reported.  The trend is likely to cheer supporters of Trump’s hardline stance on immigration. They say visas for skilled foreigners undercut American workers by replacing them with low-paid employees shipped in from abroad. But major tech companies, universities and hospitals contend the visas allow them to fill highly specialized jobs for which there are sometimes few qualified Americans.  H-1B visas allow foreign workers, generally with bachelor's degrees or higher, to work for three years at a time, often in the technology, healthcare and education sectors. Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Google (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Intel (INTC.O), Oracle (ORCL.N) and Facebook (FB.O) were heavy users of H-1B visas in 2016, according to USCIS data.  The USCIS inquiries typically challenge the basis of the original petitions and assert that the employers do not qualify for the visas. Employers and their lawyers must then provide further evidence to prove their need and eligibility for the visas.  To be sure, the Obama administration also issued a large number of H-1B challenges – nearly 59,000 - from January through August 2016, and a similar number in 2015.  Immigration attorneys have for years complained about redundant and burdensome challenges to high-skilled employment visas. But they say they are seeing a new trend in the Trump era.  In addition to querying applications more often, the Trump administration is targeting entry-level jobs offered to skilled foreigners. The lawyers say this violates the law governing H-1Bs, because it allows for visa holders to take entry-level jobs.  Several attorneys said they view the increase in challenges and focus on entry-level jobs as a stealth campaign by the administration against the H-1B program in the absence of public regulatory changes or changes passed by Congress, which could be debated and decided in the open.  “One way to have an immigration policy that’s consistent with the policy that’s been articulated by the Trump administration is to put more scrutiny on H-1B cases,” said Cyrus Mehta, a New York-based immigration attorney.  USCIS spokesman Robert C. Langston did not directly address the new trend identified by lawyers or the sharp spike in RFEs this year. In an email, he said the agency is applying “currently existing policy that interprets existing statutory and regulatory requirements to evaluate petitions.”  Partners HealthCare is a healthcare system that includes Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, two prestigious teaching hospitals for Harvard Medical School. It has received more than 50 RFEs from USCIS so far this year, compared to fewer than 15 all of last year in response to a similar number of H-1B petitions, said Anthony Pawelski, an immigration attorney who handles H-1B applications for Partners.  USCIS questioned the hospitals’ connection to the university even though their applications included proof of their non-profit status, a 1948 agreement between Harvard Medical School and the hospitals and even text from the hospitals’ website referencing a 200-year history with the university, Pawelski said.  “They’re doing anything they can to delay the processing and adjudications and in their mind close any perceived loopholes,” he said.  Langston declined to comment on specific H-1B petitions.  It is still unclear how the increase in challenges will affect the number of visas issued this year. In the 2016 fiscal year, USCIS approved 87 percent of H1-B petitions. By June 30 of this year, the agency had approved 59 percent of H-1B petitions, although that number is incomplete because it does not take into account the last three months of the 2017 fiscal year, when a large portion of H-1B applications are processed.  Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have criticized H-1B visas, because the biggest beneficiaries are outsourcing firms, which critics say use the program to fill lower-level information technology jobs and replace American workers. Members of both parties have introduced legislation this year to reform the visa’s use.  In an April executive order, Trump directed a review of the H1-B program, aimed at ensuring the visas “are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid” applicants. The order itself did not implement changes but directed agencies to suggest reforms.  “What the Trump administration has done for the first time in a very long time is take seriously the fact that companies are misusing the H-1B system,” said Russell Harrison, director of government relations at IEEE-USA, the American branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  The group opposes the H-1B program but supports giving more high-skilled foreigners employment-based permanent residence.  Many of the government challenges for visas for entry-level jobs either say that the salary should be higher because the job is too complex or that the job does not count as a “specialty” occupation, as required by the H-1B program, according to a review of hundreds of RFEs by the American Immigration Lawyers Association provided to Reuters.  Entry-level jobs are positions for fresh university graduates with little or no work experience. Such jobs can pay “Level 1” wages, the lowest of four tiers.  “An RFE may be justified if the wage level is not appropriate for the position,” said Langston, the USCIS spokesman.  The USCIS data did not specify what positions the RFEs challenged or the reasons for the challenges.  Lawyers question the implicit argument advanced by USCIS in the challenges - that specialty jobs cannot be entry-level. They point to young doctors and engineers, for instance, who may not have work experience but have spent years learning technical skills.  Though the challenges can come across all industries, the AILA review showed software developers and computer systems analysts were challenged more often than other jobs.  Silicon Valley tech giants either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on whether they had been receiving more RFEs.  The requests can increase legal fees associated with each H-1B visa by as much as half, attorneys said. Government fees for H-1B visas can run upwards of $2,500, and standard fees paid to lawyers per application can easily reach $2,000 or more.  The increased costs and hassle could discourage employers from hiring such foreign workers especially at junior levels, immigration lawyers said.  Jeffrey Gorsky, an attorney with Berry Appelman & Leiden LLP, one of the largest corporate immigration firms in the country, said one of the firm’s clients, a mid-sized tech company, was hit with six RFEs from USCIS in a single day this year.  Between late 2015 and the end of 2016, the company received just one RFE on an H-1B visa petition, he said.",politicsNews,"September 20, 2017 ",0
3362,Cautious Comey expected in U.S. hearing on Trump-Russia probes,"Former FBI chief James Comey will likely hold back from accusing President Donald Trump of trying to interfere with an  investigation into links between Trump’s election campaign team and Russian officials when he testifies in Congress this week, legal sources said. Comey’s highly anticipated appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday could be a turning point in a controversy that has rocked Trump’s young administration. In his first public remarks since Trump fired him last month, Comey is expected to tell the Senate Intelligence committee that Trump asked him during a meeting in the Oval Office to end the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s probe into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia. Comey may also detail other conversations with Trump.  Two legal experts said Comey would seek to avoid compromising a new inquiry led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller or separate congressional investigations. “I would expect him to hew pretty closely to facts and events,” said Jack Sharman, a partner at Lightfoot, Franklin and White and former special counsel to a congressional committee that investigated President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Another source, who asked not to be named, said Comey does not see it as his role to charge the president or anyone else with obstruction of justice or any other crime. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, but to affect the election’s outcome. Comey told the House of Representatives intelligence committee on March 20 that the FBI was probing Moscow’s role in the election, including possible Trump campaign collusion. Trump fired Comey on May 9, a step that stunned Washington and intensified scrutiny of the matter. Michael Flynn, Trump’s national security adviser, was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about contacts Flynn had with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. Federal prosecutors last month issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen.  The Senate intelligence panel also issued its first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. The first roughly 600 pages of those documents were delivered on Tuesday.",politicsNews,"June 7, 2017 ",1

And to top it off, Ryan once again turned down an opportunity to grow a spine and stand up to Trump and his dangerous, divisive campaign. Instead of condemning Trump for his comments as many top officials are doing, Ryan insisted that a President Trump would bring better receptivity of our agenda  than Clinton.

9290,Clinton attacks Trump's foreign policy as a threat to U.S. safety,"U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton lambasted  Donald Trump’s foreign policy platform as “dangerously incoherent” in a speech on Thursday that cast her Republican rival as both a frightening and laughable figure. In remarks that at times resembled a comedy roast, Clinton unleashed a torrent of polished zingers and one-liners to attack Trump’s policies and character, suggesting Trump might start a nuclear war if elected to the White House simply because “somebody got under his very thin skin.”  “Donald Trump’s ideas are not just different, they are dangerously incoherent,” she said to a room of supporters in San Diego, California. “They’re not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies.” Clinton, the front-runner in the race to become the Democratic presidential nominee, delivered her speech as she seeks to shift her attention to the Nov. 8 election against likely rival Trump and away from Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, who is continuing his long-shot bid for the nomination. Clinton was speaking in San Diego ahead of California’s June 7 primary election. Democratic Party leaders have fretted about how to best oppose Trump, who managed to knock out all 16 rivals for the Republican nomination in part with his uninhibited style of assailing them with personal insults. Trump revels in referring to Clinton as “Crooked Hillary” and dredging up the infidelities of her husband, Bill Clinton, the former president. Clinton’s remarks were intended in part to show she would not be cowed and that she could go toe-to-toe with him in scornful put-downs. “He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia,” she said as the crowd guffawed, and she suggested Trump would run the U.S. economy “like one of his casinos.” During her speech, Clinton predicted Trump, who has been deeply critical of Clinton’s foreign policy record, would take to his Twitter account to insult her, and he did. “Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton!” ran one posting during the speech, which included a typo. “Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn’t even look presidential!” Trump has said previously that Clinton is distorting his actual policies. Amid the laugh lines, Clinton cited her own experience as secretary of state, in particular her role advising President Barack Obama during the mission to kill al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, to suggest her approach to foreign policy was the more serious. “He praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our friends, including the British prime minister, the mayor of London, the German chancellor, the president of Mexico and the pope,” Clinton said, listing some of the allies with whom Trump has verbally sparred in the last year. Obama, who has also been repeatedly mocked by Trump, has criticized Trump as being ignorant or cavalier about world affairs and has said that Trump’s rise has “rattled” foreign leaders. Trump has talked tough on foreign policy. He has said he would bring back waterboarding and other brutal interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects that are widely regarded as torture and were discontinued by Obama. Trump has also vowed to renegotiate trade deals, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, and said he would ask members of the 28-nation NATO alliance to “pay up” or “get out.” He has said he would sit down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang’s nuclear program. Clinton derided these and other positions, promising she would do a better job keeping the United States safe. Standing in front of a backdrop of 19 large U.S. flags, an unusual abundance even by the standards of presidential campaign events, Clinton painted the election as a choice between “two very different visions.” “One that’s angry, afraid and based on the idea that America is fundamentally weak and in decline,” she said, summing up Trumpism. “The other is hopeful, generous and confident in the knowledge that America is great, just like we always have been.” Trump has criticized Clinton for her handling of foreign policy during her 2009-2013 stint as secretary of state, including the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamist militants on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. He cites Clinton’s support for the war in Iraq, launched by former Republican President George W. Bush, as another example of her shortcomings. Democratic challenger Sanders echoed Clinton’s concerns about Trump after her speech, though he also criticized Clinton’s foreign policy. “I agree ... that Donald Trump’s foreign policy ideas are incredibly reckless and irresponsible,” Sanders said in a statement. In criticizing Clinton, Sanders cited her vote for the war in Iraq, calling it “the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history,” and said “she has been a proponent of regime change, as in Libya, without thinking through the consequences.” In assailing each other’s suitability for the White House, Clinton and Trump are reflecting a negative voter mood ahead of next month’s party conventions that will choose the presidential nominees. Both Clinton and Trump are facing record-low favorability ratings. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken Friday through Tuesday shows half of Trump supporters say the primary reason they are going to vote for him is “I don’t want Hillary Clinton to win,” while 41 percent of Clinton supporters cite their primary reason as not wanting Trump to win.",politicsNews,"June 2, 2016 ",0

19082,UNPRECEDENTED: New York Times To Run 30 Sec Ad During Oscars…Bashing Trump…Defending FAKE News [VIDEO],"The New York Times is set to launch a television ad during the Academy Awards that seems to heavily target statements made by President Donald Trump.The 30-second ad, entitled,  The Truth,  features black text flashing on a white screen with the words  The truth is,  followed by a variety of statements.According to a report in The Hill, at least three of the statements were in reference to Trump. The truth is the media is dishonest,  reads one statement, a likely reference to Trump s frequent comments slamming the media s honesty.Here s another statement from the ad:  The truth is alternative facts are lies.  That one s an obvious reference to a comment made by Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway.The ad runs through a series of other phrases, some targeting conservative talking points such as  we have to protect our borders,   the emails are dangerous,  and  climate change is a hoax. The ad finishes up with the phrase  The truth is hard to find,  which then switches to  The truth is hard to know,  and finally concludes with  The truth is more important now than never.   MRCTVThat final phrase is pretty clearly seen as a parting shot at the Trump administration s relationship with the press:Recently the Times featured an article touting the  renewed sense of mission  for journalists in the Trump era looking to take down the Republican president by uncovering a Watergate-style scandal.The New York paper is not alone in its pretentious claims of being the guardian of truth, on Tuesday, The Washington Post added this slogan to its website:  Democracy dies in darkness.  Apparently only the light of the Post s reporting can save the nation from the  darkness  of a Trump presidency.Just on Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was forced to shoot down yet another misleading report from the Times about supposed contact between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials. On NBC s Meet the Press, he told moderator Chuck Todd:I mean we ve spent days talking about a story that says that our campaign had constant contacts with Russian spies. And I can tell you, I ve talked to the top levels of the intelligence community. And they ve assured me that that New York Times story was grossly overstated, and inaccurate and totally wrong .It is this sort of fake news stuff that is enormously important that, when you get a front page story of The New York Times without a single source on the record saying that your campaign had constant contacts   they didn t say one contact. They didn t say two contacts. It doesn t matter. We have not been informed of even that. But to say,  Constant contact? On Friday, NBC s Today was thrilled by the upcoming Times television spot, with reporter Joe Fryer declaring:  No matter who wins, politics will likely take the stage Sunday .The New York Times will even debut its first-ever Oscars ad, with the message,  The truth is more important than ever.

5109,WATCH: Gun Nut Believes Trump’s ‘Second Amendment’ Threat Is A Call To Arms,"Donald Trump s  Second Amendment  threat just took a more frightening turn.National outrage ensued after the Republican nominee suggested on Tuesday that gun owners do something to stop Hillary Clinton from nominating judges to the Supreme Court. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,  Trump said.  Although the Second Amendment people   maybe there is, I don t know. This statement prompted the Secret Service to take the unprecedented step of responding to an assassination threat by a presidential candidate against an opposing candidate, whom the Secret Service is charged with protecting and would be in the line of fire should a right-wing gun nut answer Trump s dog whistle.And it appears that at least one gun nut is interpreting Trump s dog whistle call as a call for armed insurrection if Hillary Clinton becomes president and doesn t pick who they want her to pick as a Supreme Court Justice.Greg from Michigan called into C-SPAN on Wednesday morning and while he denied that Trump was calling for Hillary to be shot and killed he frighteningly declared that Trump was actually calling for a bloody armed revolt if conservatives don t get their way. Number one, Mr. Trump was not threatening assassination of Hillary. But what he was implying and could happen is if Hillary got her way and did do away with Second Amendment rights, there are a lot of us who are gun owners who are going to object to that very strongly. And since we do have firearms, it might if it comes down to it be us having to defend our rights with those guns, just as the revolutionaries did in the Revolutionary War. Here s the video via C-SPAN:Trump s rhetoric just took a scary turn and his supporters are taking him seriously. Republicans have talked about  Second Amendment remedies  before but American voters have been consistent in rejecting candidates who spew such rhetoric. The idea of using guns to force your political agenda on the country is a threat to our democracy and has no place in this country. It s time for voters to once again reject this rhetoric by defeating Trump by a landslide. Republicans need to learn once and for all that threats of gun violence is not a political strategy and is a sure way to lose elections.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"August 10, 2016",1
6276,‘Tehran Tom’ Cotton Says The U.S. Justice System Is ‘Anglo-American’ And We Don’t Jail Enough,"The U.S. has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world, thanks to an awful lot of really bad conservative policies from the 1970s and 1980s designed to make us look tough on crime. Mandatory minimum sentencing, imprisonment for crimes that don t really require it, and more, has not only put millions of Americans in prison, but has had a disproportionate affect on minorities. Is crime down from 30 years ago? Sure. But Senator  Tehran Tom  Cotton thinks we re actually  under-incarcerating. Seriously. You can t make this stuff up. He actually labors under the delusion that we aren t putting enough people in prison. Speaking to the Hudson Institute about a bipartisan crime reform bill currently before Congress, he actually said: First, the claim that too many criminals are being jailed, that there is over-incarceration, ignores an unfortunate fact: for the vast majority of crimes, a perpetrator is never identified or arrested, let alone prosecuted, convicted, and jailed. Law enforcement is able to arrest or identify a likely perpetrator for only 19 percent of property crimes and 47 percent of violent crimes. If anything, we have an under-incarceration problem. He slammed the pro-leniency crowd, and complained that just a tiny fraction of the federal prison population consisted of people incarcerated for something like drug possession. However, the Federal Bureau of Prisons says that nearly half their prison population is there for drug offenses, which are defined as use, sale, possession, or furnishing of illegal drugs. 16 percent of the state prison population is incarcerated for drug offenses.Cotton doesn t let pesky things like facts bother him, though. What s next? A three-year mandatory minimum sentence for unpaid parking tickets? Perhaps a five-year prison sentence for violating pet-limit laws? Who knows with this guy.Besides all of that, the U.S. has 5 percent of the world s population, and 25 percent of the world s prison population. 2.3 million people are in prison here, and nearly half of them are black.Any guesses as to what Tom Cotton thinks of that? He either hasn t noticed (unlikely), or he s got the racist idea in his head that there s something wrong with black people that makes them commit more crime (far more likely). Something else he said, about unjust sentences, could be interpreted that way: I don t discount the possibility of a manifestly unjust sentence, one so out of proportion to the crime that it shocks the conscience. But that s why the Anglo-American system of justice gives the pardon power to the executive.  [emphasis mine]Anglo-American system of justice? There s really nothing to say about that other than,  Wow, this man is racist. One question this brings up is how much he s getting paid by the private prison lobby to be this kind of a hardliner. Increasing mandatory minimum sentences and other nonsense to ensure high prison capacities is more at the behest of those people than it is a  tough on crime  policy.Cotton, who is the man behind the treasonous letter to Iran a year ago, seems to suffer from a delusion that he s actually studied the issue. His answer to crime is no answer at all   it ll make our societal ills worse. But that s what Cotton lives for. He lives for making things worse.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 20, 2016",1

20744,Florida residents heed Irma warnings after Harvey's destruction,"Hurricane Harvey s destruction in Texas may not have altered Florida s well-tested storm plans, but it appears to have infused residents with a new sense of urgency as they prepare for approaching Hurricane Irma. Officials said Harvey s devastating flooding, coupled with the sheer power of Irma, ranked as the strongest Atlantic storm on record, had sharpened the focus of Floridians who were somewhat indifferent about preparing for past hurricanes.  A lot of times they end up having hurricane parties here instead of evacuating,  Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said by phone.  That s been the opposite this time around.  Monroe County includes the Florida Keys, which ordered evacuations for all residents and tourists. Clark said she saw a steady stream of traffic leaving the travel destination as she drove to work early on Wednesday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasts that Irma may strike southern Florida on Saturday, when it could still be a major hurricane.  As it neared Puerto Rico on Wednesday with maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour (295 kph), Irma was a Category 5 storm, the highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity.  This storm is bigger, faster and stronger than Hurricane Andrew,  Florida Governor Rick Scott told a news conference on Wednesday, referring to one of the costliest storms in U.S. history that struck southern Miami-Dade County 25 years ago. For south Florida, Hurricane Irma  is a once-in-a-generation storm. It s the Big One for us,  Ed Rappaport, acting director of the hurricane center, told WFOR-TV in Miami on Wednesday evening.  Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez on Wednesday evening announced mandatory evacuations for most of the county s coastal cities beginning at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) on Thursday. Miami-Dade has a population of 2.7 million. The evacuation orders affect more than 100,000 residents, the Miami Herald reported. Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine had already urged residents of that city on Tuesday to evacuate.  We don t want any heroes,  he said.  We want people to bring themselves to a safer place than a barrier island.  Officials across Florida said they saw signs of people taking Irma more seriously than past storms.  Residents were stocking up on water and batteries and even complaining that county leaders were not being quick enough to announce evacuations, said Don Walker, spokesman for Brevard County Emergency Management. Houston officials were criticized for not ordering an evacuation ahead of the flooding that left hundreds of people in the country s fourth-largest city trapped in their homes.  Everyone is really in tune with this storm system. My neighbors are talking about it, and we don t usually do that,  Walker said. For years, many Florida residents, joined by an ever-growing number of newcomers, paid little heed to hurricane warnings as most opted to stay in their homes, county officials said. Not this time around.  I ll tell you for the community, heck yeah, they re taking this more seriously,  said Teri Barbera, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff s Office, noting that many stores were out of bottled water by Monday.

858,U.S. draft U.N. resolution seeks extension of Syria chemical probe,"The United States has circulated a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would extend by two years the mandate of an international inquiry into chemical weapons attacks in Syria, after Russia vetoed an extension last week. The U.S. draft, which was seen by Reuters on Thursday, says Syria must not develop or produce chemical weapons, and it calls on all parties in Syria to provide full cooperation with the international probe. The investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) - was unanimously created by the 15-member Security Council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November. The JIM found that the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad was to blame for a chemical attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people in April, according to a report sent to the Security Council on Oct. 26. Two days earlier, Russia vetoed a renewal of the JIM mandate after it was unsuccessful in getting the Security Council to postpone the vote. U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Russia wanted to discuss the Khan Sheikhoun report before the vote. Russia, whose air force and special forces have been supporting the Syrian army, says there is no evidence to show Damascus was responsible for the attack. It maintains that the chemicals that killed civilians belonged to rebels, not Assad’s government. [nL8N1N86I0] On Wednesday, the United States admonished Russia for its veto. [nL2N1N805Y] “Russia’s attempts to undermine and eliminate the JIM show a callous disregard for the suffering and loss of life caused by the use of chemical weapons and an utter lack of respect for international norms,” the White House said in a statement.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by phone on Thursday it was unacceptable to politicize the work of chemical weapons inspectors in Syria, Russia’s foreign ministry said. [nL8N1MP0GI] A Russian draft resolution calls for a six-month extension of the inquiry, with the possibility of further extensions, and asks for investigators to collect environmental samples in connection with the Khan Sheikhoun probe, among other things. In their 14th report since 2011, U.N. investigators said in September they had documented 33 chemical weapons attacks to date. [nL8N1LN29P] Twenty-seven were by the Assad government, including seven between March 1 and July 7. Perpetrators had not been identified yet in six attacks, they said. The Assad government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. It said its strikes in Khan Sheikhoun hit a weapons depot belonging to rebel forces, an assertion “excluded” by U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria Chairman Paulo Pinheiro. That attack led U.S. President Donald Trump to launch the first U.S. air strikes on a Syrian air base.",politicsNews,"November 3, 2017 ",0

9977,"Not an endorsement, but close; Obama comments hint at support for Clinton","President Barack Obama seemed to inch a little closer on Tuesday to endorsing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid. During remarks at a museum dedicated to highlighting the fight for women’s equality, the president, who has made clear his admiration for his one-time rival but has not officially endorsed her, said he hoped one day people would be amazed that the United States had not had a female commander-in-chief. “I want young girls and boys to come here, 10, 20, 100 years from now to know that women fought for equality, it was not just given to them,” Obama said of the museum. “I want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women were vastly outnumbered in the board room or in Congress. That there was ever a time when a woman had never sat in the Oval Office.” Clinton is running against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to be the Democratic Party’s 2016 presidential candidate. She lost the 2008 race to Obama, who was then a U.S. senator and who later made her the nation’s top diplomat in his administration. Obama, perhaps realizing that people would read his remarks as a hint of support for Clinton, tempered them by saying he did not know when a woman would win the White House. “I don’t know how long it’ll take to get there, but I know we’re getting closer to that day because of the work of generations of active, committed citizens,” he said. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama’s remarks indicated the country was ready for a woman president, but he stressed the candidates would be judged on their values and policy agenda. Obama remains hugely popular with the base of Democratic supporters who helped propel him to the White House and re-elect him in 2012. An endorsement of Clinton could help her vanquish Sanders, who is behind the former first lady in amassing the number of delegates needed to become the nominee but has remained a strong challenger with wins in a number of state nominating contests.",politicsNews,"April 12, 2016 ",1
20724,Three policemen killed in Peru in drug-trafficking region: government,"Three Peruvian policemen were killed in an attack on patrol vehicles in a drug-trafficking region controlled by a remnant band of Shining Path rebels, the interior ministry said on Thursday. Authorities are investigating the attack, which occurred late on Wednesday in the jungle region known as the VRAEM, where most of Peru s cocaine is produced, the ministry said. The Maoist-inspired Shining Path largely ended its armed rebellion in the 1990s on orders from the group s leaders.  But a faction that refused to put down its weapons occasionally ambushes state security forces in the region, where rebels work with drug traffickers. So far this year, nine police or military officers have been killed in the VRAEM in a sign the Shining Path faction has regrouped after two top leaders were killed in 2013, said Peruvian security analyst Pedro Yaranga.

22815,Lavrov to Trump: ‘Do Not Attack Venezuela’,"21st Century Wire says Last Friday, President Donald Trump appears to have temporarily lost his mind by suggesting that the US may act militarily against Venezuela. The rationale (or irrationale) seems to be that (US-backed) protests against the rule of President Nicolas Maduro are destabilizing the country and therefore, the US must intervene if Maduro does not  go . It was shades of the last 7 years of US and western anti-Syrian  regime change  rhetoric. Washington will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles,  he said.Vice President Mike Pence is on a four-nation Latin American tour, where he expressed his concern that Venezuela will trigger regional instability in South America.Meanwhile, other Latin America countries have now rallied around Venezuela after Trump s off-handed comments. This has been somewhat of an own goal by Trump who seems to have now united Latin America in support of Venezuela   and against the United States.Venezuela foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, urged Venezuelans to resist America s  insolent foreign aggression . The reckless threats of President Donald Trump aim to drag  Latin America and the Caribbean into a conflict which would permanently alter the stability, the peace and the security of our region,  said Arreaza.To compound Washington s problems on the issue, Russia has now also weighed in The DuranSergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister was speaking with his Bolivian counterpart when the issue of Venezuela arose. Bolivia is one of Venezuela s closest regional allies along with Cuba.Sergey Lavrov responded to threats made by Donald Trump against Caracas when the US President threatened the use of military action against the oil rich South American country. Venezuela has called Trump s threats  crazy  and a threat to the sovereignty of the country.Today, Lavrov stated: We are united in the need to overcome the existing disagreements in the country by peaceful means through a nationwide dialogue as soon as possible, without any external pressure, not to mention the unacceptability of the threats of military intervention in the internal affairs of this country .Recently Mercosur, a bloc of nations covering the majority of South America condemned any attempts by the US to stage a war against Venezuela. This included countries who themselves have disagreements with Caracas.

4684,Instant View: Republicans pull Obamacare repeal bill,"Republican leaders of the House of Representatives pulled legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system from consideration on Friday due to a shortage of votes, despite desperate lobbying by the White House and its allies in Congress, dealing a stiff setback to President Donald Trump. DANIEL MORGAN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SYNOVUS TRUST COMPANY, ATLANTA, GEORGIA: “There’s a bit of a relief rally. There were worries going into it... but it’s a mixed bag. “It does now open the door for maybe they table the whole thing and just move on, and I would think the next thing on the docket would have to be tax reform. The market, to me, is more interested in tax reform than it is in changing Obamacare. “In a way, for me, sitting on $600 million worth of investments, I think it’s great. Let’s move and get into tax reform, and then get into the infrastructure bill.” PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: “The market is relieved it’s not going to go down to a defeat, and it’s hopeful they’ll come to some sort of agreement over the weekend. The market is hoping for an agreement as a stepping stone to additional agreements.” “News report suggested that the likely outcome was they were going to lose. I would think the expectations are that they’re pulling it so they can work on it.” “The last few days, market has sort of traded on the back foot on anticipation of the vote that would happen at some point this week. Generally, risk sentiment has been undermined off of that, especially with this steady drip of news that indicated lacking support for the bill. And now, I think, it sort of lifted that uncertainty, at least temporarily, for the rest of the day. Maybe just lifting the uncertainty premium has markets breathing a sigh of relief for now.” PARESH UPADHYAYA, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, PIONEER INVESTMENTS, BOSTON: “The initial market interpretation is a positive sign. It seems like it is taking that Trump wants to instead of sinking it, he wants to give it another shot. It seems like they think he is working to get something on his agenda to be passed by Congress. Or perhaps it’s a sign that if healthcare reform is shelved, Trump will focus on tax reform. It’s more a knee jerk reaction.  “There are still a lot of hard questions regardless to tax reform. He can’t force people to change their vote on social media. Good old fashion politicking is needed to build consensus.  “If this stronger dollar has legs, it depends on the next step. If there is a pivot to taxes from healthcare, the market has to see the plan.” RAHUL SHAH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, IDEAL ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: “From an investor viewpoint, it shows that Trump will not be able to easily pass his agenda. That being said, healthcare is more difficult to pass than tax cuts and the infrastructure bill that he’s proposing. “In one sense that’s a negative, but on the other hand it also might give some relief to investors who are concerned about some of Trump’s more controversial proposals like increased tariffs and a border adjustment tax.  “You could see this as a glass half empty or a glass half-full, gridlock is not something that’s unheard of on Wall Street, so I think stocks should be OK going forward.” “I think the most important thing is that this changes the perception of the relationship between Trump and Congress. For the last few months the assumption has been that Congress would do whatever the Trump plan called for, and that apparently is not going to be the case.” PETER KENNY, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, GLOBAL MARKETS ADVISORY GROUP, NEW YORK: “I don’t think it’s going to have a huge impact on equities, although it may have more of an impact on biotech and healthcare.  “This is now an indication that the president’s agenda is probably going to be more ambitious than Congress can manage. It is probably going to mean that equity markets are going to have to factor in a degree of dysfunction that investors were hoping they wouldn’t have to. Which means it will likely have a muted impact on equity performance moving forward.  “There is very little on the horizon as of right now, as a result of this thing being pulled, that is going to fuel a significant move higher in prices. This is largely going to homogenize any sort of volatility moving forward and is probably going to be a cap on any near-term performance in terms of the upside. “The fact this bill, which the President has said flat-out he will make it work for all Americans in general, can’t pass is an indication this agenda is going to be more ambitious than this Congress can work with. This doesn’t even include the Democrats. It is not just divided between Democrats and Republicans, it is divided between progressives, Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians. It is an indication that investors should not expect the kind of velocity in terms of agenda accomplishments they were expecting when he was elected.” MARGARET PATEL, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WELLS FARGO ASSET MANAGEMENT, BOSTON: “It looked like the market was worried that the Trump agenda would get completely bogged down in the healthcare issue, and now that they’ve taken the healthcare issue off the table, I think the market is more optimistic that they can do other things that are more doable that are not so complicated, such as regulatory reform and lowering taxes. It does seem like a positive move to shelve an issue that’s so complex and very expensive no matter what the plan, move on to something that is a little bit easier, which would be lowering taxes.” BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO: “It didn’t pass and it didn’t fail so any conjecture about the ultimate meaning is premature.

Outspoken conservative GOP Presidential candidates like Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee and Carly Fiorina started fighting back against the liberal media at the outset of the presidential election season, opening the door for conservatives like Steve Cortes to fight back when appropriate and boy, was this the appropriate time!MSNBC s Joy Reid, filling in for Chris Hayes, goes head-to-head with Steve Cortes, a Latino Trump supporter of Donald Trump, for using the term  illegals  to describe illegal immigrants.Reid was also incredulous that Cortes would use that term, being that he is a Hispanic. Cortes told Reid his parents came to the U.S. legally. She wasn t impressed and lectured Cortes that she is also the daughter of immigrants. When it comes to the bedrock principles, I don t disagree with him at all,  Cortes defended Trump on Thursday s broadcast of MSNBC s All In with Chris Hayes.  Those are twofold. Number one, we have to secure our border. Number two, there can be no citizenship for illegals. You cannot reward criminality. Reid stopped him right there. Hold on a second,  the MSNBCer said. I m going to stop you right there. You are Hispanic, Steve. Are you comfortable with that term, illegals? That is a pejorative to a lot of people. Why do you use that term?  Reid asked, not believing a Latino would use such a term. You know why, because words matter,  Cortes said. Yeah, they do,  Reid shot back. If you do something that is against the law, it s illegal,  Cortes reminded Reid.  If you go into a store and you shoplift, you re not an undocumented holder of a good, you re a thief. If you come to the United States against the immigration laws of the United States, you re not undocumented, You re illegal. You said that you didn t agree with all the things he said last night. point out two or three of the things that you did not like?  Reid asked.

14838,Duterte berates Canada's Trudeau at end of Philippines summit,"Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte attacked Canada s Justin Trudeau at the end of a summit of Asian and Western nations for raising questions about his war on drugs, a topic skirted by other leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump. At the traditional news conference by the host nation at the end of the summit on Tuesday, Duterte was asked how he had responded to the Canadian prime minister raising the issue of human rights and extra-judicial killings in his anti-drugs drive.  I said I will not explain. It is a personal and official insult,  the Philippines president said in the course of a rambling answer, although he did not refer to Trudeau by name.  I only answer to the Filipino. I will not answer to any other bullshit, especially foreigners. Lay off.  Earlier in the day, Trudeau told a news conference that during his meeting with Duterte  the president was receptive to my comments and it was throughout a very cordial and positive exchange . Human rights activists had been hoping that leaders at the summit, including Trump, would raise the issue of the thousands of users and small-time pushers killed in the campaign that was launched by Duterte after he took office in mid-2016. His government says the police act in self-defense during drug-busts, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability. There was no pressure from Trump on the drugs war when he met Duterte on Monday and the U.S. president later said the two had a  great relationship . A joint statement after the meeting only said the two sides  underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs.  Duterte cursed Trump s predecessor, Barack Obama, last year for raising concerns about the war on drugs and he subsequently declared that he was breaking ties with the United States, a close ally of the Philippines since World War Two. The relationship appears to have got back on track after the bonhomie between him and Trump. Trudeau also said that he raised the issue of the exodus of Rohingya during a meeting with Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, another sensitive topic bypassed by most other leaders, although he did not mention the Muslim minority by name.  This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,  he said. The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize the term. Over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh since military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25.  The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and the United Nations has called the operations ethnic cleansing. There have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the military s actions. Some countries in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced strong concern over the issue recently. However, in keeping with ASEAN s principle of non-interference in each others  internal affairs, it appeared to have been put aside at the summit, which brought Southeast Asian nations together with the United States, Russia, Japan, China, India, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Duterte reported that China had agreed at the summit to work on a code of conduct in the South China Sea with ASEAN nations to ease tensions over disputed claims to the busy and resource-rich waterway. The group also signed agreements on protecting migrant labor and fighting terrorism and cybercrime. Trump skipped the plenary session of the summit because of scheduling delays, but he said his marathon trip to Asia had been a  tremendous  success. He told reporters on Air Force One that he had delivered his prepared remarks during a lunch before the summit meeting.  Trump said at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure, of deals had been agreed in the trip. He did not elaborate.  We ve explained that the United States is open for trade but we want reciprocal, we want fair trade for the United States,  he said. Trade and concern about possible protectionism under Trump s  America First  agenda have come up during his visit to the region, which included stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam before concluding in the Philippines. After Trump left Manila, a group of Asia-Pacific nations pursuing a separate Beijing-backed trade deal that does not include the United States agreed to  intensify efforts  in 2018 to bring their negotiations to a conclusion. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) appeared to have been given new impetus at the summit by Trump s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, to which China is not party. The two trade deals are not mutually exclusive. ASEAN is joined in the RCEP talks by China, India, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea.",worldnews,"November 14, 2017 ",1
8358,Trump vows crackdown on immigrants who overstay visas if elected,"U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump offered fresh details of how he would tackle illegal immigration on Saturday, saying he would crack down on those who overstay their visas as he sought to quiet criticism from conservatives. In a campaign speech in Des Moines, Iowa, Trump also cited the shooting death of a cousin of NBA star Dwyane Wade to urge African-American voters to rally behind him, calling it an example of violence that has to be addressed. Trump, speaking on the Iowa State Fairgrounds with hay bales stacked behind him, sought to clarify his views on how to overhaul the U.S. immigration system after saying earlier in the week that he was softening on his plan to deport all 11 million illegal immigrants. That stance drew fire from conservatives who wanted him to stand fast after he won the Republican presidential nomination in large part by a hardline stance that would include building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. In his speech, Trump said he would seek to institute a tracking system to ensure illegal immigrants who overstay their visas are quickly removed, and would propose an e-verify system to prevent the illegal community from gaining access to welfare and other benefits. “If we don’t enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border – it’s as simple as that,” he said. In outlining his views, Trump said addressing illegal immigration is important to helping Americans find jobs. “Every time an African-American citizen, or any citizen, loses their job to an illegal immigrant, the rights of that American citizen have been violated,” he said. “Equal protection under the law must include the consistent application of our immigration laws.” Trump said his first priority upon taking office next January would be the immediate deportation of thousands of illegal immigrants who remain in the United States despite having committed crimes. “These international gangs and cartels will be a thing of the past. Their reign of terror will be over. In this task, we will always err on the side of protecting the American people – we will use immigration law to prevent crimes, and will not wait until some innocent American has been harmed or killed before taking action,” he said. He did not explain how his plan would affect many of the illegal community who have been in the United States for decades and obeyed U.S. laws. Trump said the death in Chicago of Wade cousin Nykea Aldridge, 32, a mother of four, was an example of turmoil in U.S. inner cities. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff to Democratic President Barack Obama, has struggled in particular to contain violence in his city. The incident permitted Trump to bring up again his desire to be a “law and order” president and underscore his drive to appeal to African-American voters who traditionally vote Democratic and overwhelmingly support Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. “It breaks all of our hearts to see it, it’s horrible,” Trump said. “And it’s only getting worse. This shouldn’t happen in our country. This shouldn’t happen in America. We send our thoughts and our prayers to the family, and we also promise to fight for a much, much better tomorrow.” Trump raised the subject after sending out tweets earlier in the day that prompted charges of insensitivity to the death and accusations he sought to exploit it for political purposes. The New York businessman was the headline speaker at “Joni Ernst’s Roast and Ride,” a charity event for military veterans run by U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican. Ernst and most other speakers offered praise for Trump, a rarity at a time when many Republican political leaders have distanced themselves from his candidacy due to his incendiary rhetoric. Trump is running neck and neck with Clinton in polls in the state with 72 days until the Nov. 8 election.",politicsNews,"August 27, 2016 ",0
6677,Trump ordered to give deposition in Washington restaurant suit,"A Washington judge has ordered Republican President-elect Donald Trump to give a deposition in a lawsuit against celebrity chef Jose Andres stemming from Trump’s disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants. District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Jennifer Di Toro ruled on Wednesday that Trump must testify in New York about Andres’ restaurant deal at Trump’s luxury Washington hotel. The deposition can last up to seven hours and will take place in the first week of January. His lawyers had sought to limit how long Trump could be questioned and what could be covered, contending he was extremely busy ahead of his Jan. 20 inauguration. But Di Toro said in her order that limits on the deposition could harm preparations by Andres’ lawyers, and that Trump’s own statements were at the heart of the case. Trump is suing Andres for $10 million over breach of contract after Andres backed out of a plan to open a restaurant in the Trump International Hotel a few blocks from the White House. Andres, who was born in Spain and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, has said he canceled the project after Trump denounced Mexican immigrants in June 2015 as drug dealers and rapists. Andres has argued that the comments made it difficult to attract Hispanic staff and customers and to raise money for a Spanish restaurant. Trump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Chef Geoffrey Zakarian also pulled out of a restaurant deal at the hotel, citing Trump’s remarks. Trump has sued Zakarian for breach of contract and was deposed in that case in June. Andres suggested in a tweet on Tuesday that the two sides wrap up the lawsuit and donate money to a veterans’ group instead. “Why keep litigating? Let’s both of us win,” he said. The hotel has drawn fire from critics who say it poses a potential conflict of interest since Trump is leasing the site, a historic former post office, from the federal government.",politicsNews,"December 15, 2016 ",0
15919,Ecuador president removed as head of ruling party as feud deepens,"Ecuador s ruling Country Alliance party, founded by former president Rafael Correa over a decade ago, has removed President Lenin Moreno as its head, citing  repeated failures  in leadership, as a schism between the former allies deepens. The Country Alliance party, which has been divided by the two politicians, late on Tuesday announced that Correa ally Ricardo Patino, a former foreign minister, would replace Moreno as party leader.  The head of the national Country Alliance party has unanimously decided,  it said in a statement announcing  the immediate removal of Lenin Moreno as president of the Country Alliance party.  Ecuador s government, however, said it did not recognize the decision and stressed Moreno remained the head of the party.   Country Alliance is a political party, not an estate ... These actions are wrong and do not reflect the feeling of our political base,  acting vice president Alejandra Vicuna told journalists on Tuesday. Moreno, a Correa prot g  who previously served as his vice president, was elected earlier this year to succeed the fiery leftist. At the time, opposition critics warned Moreno would be a puppet of political heavyweight Correa, whom they accused of seeking to stage a presidential comeback in 2021. But Moreno, a paraplegic former United Nations special envoy on disability, has stunned the Andean country of around 17 million by quickly breaking with Correa, who is now living abroad, in his wife s home country of Belgium.      Moreno, who is seeking presidential term limits via a referendum to revise the constitution, has sidelined another top Correa ally from the vice presidency, and is overseeing a corruption probe that has ensnared former high-level officials. Vicuna replaced Jorge Glas, who was also Correa s vice president, after Glas came under investigation in a corruption scandal centered on Brazilian construction company Odebrecht. He is currently in jail. Polls indicate Moreno has widespread popular support in Ecuador. His approval levels have jumped from around 66 percent in May, when he was sworn in, to about 77 percent in September, a recent survey by local pollster Cedatos showed.  Many Ecuadoreans report being satisfied with his attempts to investigate corruption and boost social welfare. His conciliatory temperament is also welcomed by some who were tired of Correa s confrontational style.",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",0
19879,"Ex-Nusra vows to fight on in Syria, denounces de-escalation deal","The former al Qaeda branch in Syria has pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies, and denounced ceasefire talks in Kazakhstan.   Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed on Friday to deploy observers on the edge of a  de-escalation  zone in Syria s Idlib province, which is largely under the control of Islamist insurgents.  While they hailed the agreement as a breakthrough after months of talks in the Kazakh capital Astana, they gave few details. The move falls under a broader deal in which they would set up four such zones across Syria.   The de-escalation plan has eased fighting in parts of western Syria between rebel factions and government forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.  But the ex-Nusra Front said the Astana process amounted to the surrender of rebel-held pockets, and what had started with a ceasefire would  end with restoring Bashar s rule to the areas . The group cut ties with al-Qaeda last year, rebranded, and now spearheads the Tahrir al-Sham jihadist alliance, controlling parts of the northwestern Idlib province, on the border with Turkey.  At least two million people live in Idlib, the largest populated area held by rebels - including some nationalist Free Syrian Army factions that have taken part in the Astana talks. Idlib s has population ballooned as thousands of civilians and fighters have left areas the Syrian army seized, with the help of Russian jets and Iran-backed militias.  Tahrir al-Sham criticized FSA rebels who have attended the Astana meetings, which began with Moscow-led diplomatic efforts separate from U.N.-based peace talks in Geneva.  We fear the day will come when those factions will line up alongside Russian warplanes and fight those who reject Assad and his regime,  it said in its statement. Bouthaina Shaaban, a senior aide to Assad, said on Friday that attempts to divide Syria had failed, and repeated the government s vow to take back the entire country, including  Idlib and other areas . Assad has gained the military upper hand against an array of rebel groups, including some that have received backing from the United States, Turkey and Gulf monarchies.  Damascus views any presence of Turkish forces as illegitimate, Syrian state news agency SANA cited a foreign ministry source as saying on Saturday.  The deal for Idlib is temporary. Its main goal is reviving the old Damascus-Hama-Aleppo road...and for all kinds of traffic to flow to Aleppo,  the source said. The government took full control of Aleppo city, east of Idlib, last year in a major blow to rebels.  Critics have described the de-escalation plan as de facto partitioning of Syria after years of multi-sided conflict. Moscow, Tehran, and Ankara deny this and say the zones will be temporary, although they could extend beyond the initial six-month term.",worldnews,"September 16, 2017 ",0

10991,Connecticut's governor says no return to pre-recession prosperity,"Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy delivered a downbeat address on Wednesday, outlining plans to slash government spending and admitting to “a visceral feeling” that there was no going back to the prosperity of pre-recession years. The short and somber address came on the heels of a presentation by Malloy’s top budget official, who called for $570 million of reductions next year on top of millions in cuts and tax hikes in previous years. “Our national economy, while making progress from the Great Recession, was fundamentally changed,” Malloy, a Democrat, said at his annual state of the state address. “A shifting workforce, the rapid rise of technology, and stagnant wage growth have made this recovery tougher for everyone, everywhere.” Connecticut has consistently lagged the national economic recovery and has been hit by job losses in its key financial and high-tech manufacturing industries.  The state has one of the worst funded pension systems in the nation. With required payments set to balloon to $6 billion by 2032, the system presents a significant risk to the budget. “Connecticut is not going back to that pre-recession reality,” Malloy told the Democrat-dominated legislature. “It just doesn’t exist anymore.” Connecticut’s woes show how U.S. states have shared unevenly in the recovery since the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Andrew Cuomo, governor of neighboring New York, felt confident enough to tout a $100 billion infrastructure plan in January. “It’s been a really hard recovery,” said Douglas Offerman, an analyst at Fitch Ratings. “The old paradigm that you would exceed your past peak in every expansion doesn’t appear to be holding right now.” Ben Barnes, Malloy’s top budget official, said the replacement of higher-paying jobs with lower- and middle-wage positions had been a “major story” in Connecticut’s budget ills.  Barnes proposed cuts of 5.75 percent to the budgets of state agencies, which could mean the elimination of several thousand jobs. He said cuts to discretionary spending would amount to 15 percent over two years.  At the start of the legislative session, Malloy urged lawmakers to pass an early budget and not wait until the last day of the fiscal year on June 30. But he said he would not circumvent the process. The governor proposed overhauling the way the state runs its budget to bring the process more in line with revenue projections, shifting away from a “current services” model. He also said lawmakers should implement a spending cap.",politicsNews,"February 3, 2016 ",1
20483,Canada deported hundreds to war-torn countries: government data,"Canada has deported hundreds of people to countries designated too dangerous for civilians, with more than half of those people being sent back to Iraq, according to government data obtained by Reuters. The spike in deportations comes as Canada faces a record number of migrants and is on track to have the most refugee claims in more than a decade. That has left the country scrambling to cope with the influx of asylum seekers, many crossing the U.S. border illegally. Between January 2014 and Sept. 6, 2017, Canada sent 249 people to 11 countries for which the government had suspended or deferred deportations because of dangers to civilians. That includes 134 people to Iraq, 62 to the Democratic Republic of Congo and 43 to Afghanistan, the data shows.  The number of Iraq deportations increased from 22 in 2014 to 51 in 2016 and stands at 35 so far this year.  The decision to remove someone from Canada is not taken lightly,  Canada Border Services Agency spokeswoman Patrizia Giolti wrote in an email.   Everyone ordered removed from Canada is entitled to due process before the law, and all removal orders are subject to various levels of appeal.  The Canada Council for Refugees has said existing avenues of appeal are too limited, leaving little recourse for people facing deportation to dangerous countries. Canada can deport anyone who is not a citizen, for reasons including criminality, exhausting attempts to obtain permanent residency and non-compliance with immigration laws.  The federal government has suspension or deferral designations for countries or regions deemed dangerous but may still deport people to them because of criminality, security risks or human rights violations. The United Nations  High Commission on Refugees recommends states refrain from deporting people to Iraq because of the human rights situation and the conflict there, said Jean-Nicholas Beuze, the organization s Canadian representative. But some regions, such as Kurdistan, are safer, he added.  The responsibility is on the state sending people back to those countries to make sure ... that those people will not become internally displaced within their own country and dependent on humanitarian aid,  Beuze said.     In July, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked the deportation of more than 1,400 Iraqis, many with criminal charges or convictions. They had claimed they would face death or persecution if they return to their home country because they belonged to minority groups, including Chaldean Catholics, Sunni Muslims or Iraqi Kurds.",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",0
3596,"Pope asks Trump to be peacemaker, gives him environmental letter","Pope Francis urged U.S. President Donald Trump to be a peacemaker at their first meeting on Wednesday after they exchanged sharp words last year, and Trump promised he would not forget the pontiff’s message. Under clear blue skies, Trump received a tribute from the Swiss Guard in a Vatican courtyard when he arrived. He entered a small elevator taking him to the third floor of the Apostolic Palace and, after a long ceremonial walk past frescoed corridors, shook the pope’s hand at the entrance to the private study that the frugal pontiff uses only for official occasions. Before the door of the wood-lined elevator closed, a Vatican protocol official was heard quipping to the president that it was not “like Trump Tower in New York”. Francis smiled faintly as he greeted Trump outside the study and was not as outgoing as he sometimes is with visiting heads of state. Trump, seeming subdued, said, “It is a great honor.” Even when the two were sitting at the pope’s desk in the presence of photographers and reporters, the pope avoided the  small talk that usually occurs before the media is ushered out. The two spoke privately for about 30 minutes with translators. Both men looked far more relaxed at the end of the private meeting, with the pope smiling and joking with Trump and his wife Melania. Francis’s interpreter could be heard translating a comment by the pope to the First Lady: “What do you give him to eat?” Francis then gave Trump a small sculptured olive tree and told him through the interpreter that it symbolized peace. “It is my desire that you become an olive tree to construct peace,” the Pope said, speaking in Spanish. Trump responded: “We can use peace.” Francis also gave Trump a signed copy of his 2017 peace message whose title is “Nonviolence -  A Style of Politics for Peace”, and a copy of his 2015 encyclical letter on the need to protect the environment from the effects of climate change. “Well, I’ll be reading them,” Trump said. During his election campaign, Trump said scientific findings that human economic activity contributed to global warming were a hoax. As president, he has proposed deep cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency and the elimination of many environmental regulations. Trump gave the pope a boxed set of five first-edition books by murdered U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King. As Trump and the pope said goodbye at the door of the study, Trump told him: “Thank you, thank you. I won’t forget what you said.” Asked how the meeting with the pope went, Trump said: “Great. He is something. He is really good. We had a fantastic meeting.” A Vatican statement said the meeting was “cordial” and that the Vatican hoped there could be “serene collaboration” between the U.S. government and the American Catholic Church, including “assistance to immigrants”. The U.S. Catholic Church hierarchy opposes Trump’s attempt to cut federal assistance for cities that give sanctuary to illegal immigrants. It also opposes his plan to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. The pope said last year a man who thinks about building walls and not bridges is “not Christian”. Trump, who was a candidate at the time, responded that it was “disgraceful” of the Argentine-born pope, who represents just over half of the world’s two billion Christians, to question his faith. The meeting with the pope was the third stop on Trump’s nine-day foreign tour, and part of his world tour of religions after meeting leaders of Muslim nations in Saudi Arabia and visiting holy sites in Jerusalem. Trump at first did not plan to stop in Rome during his visit to Europe, which some in the Vatican saw as a snub. When he changed his mind, the Vatican squeezed him in at 8:30 a.m. on a Wednesday morning, an unusual day and an unusually early time. He later flew to Brussels where he was to meet Belgium’s king and prime minister on Wednesday evening before a day of meetings with European Union and NATO leaders on Thursday.",politicsNews,"May 24, 2017 ",0

Patrick Henningsen (@21WIRE) December 29, 2017While  Make America Great Again  might be the political campaign de jour at home, these next four years are likely to coincide with an overall decline in US influence in the world.Mehr News reports During the past decades after World WarII and disintegration of the former Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the world has been dominated by the US in terms of politics, military and economy. But the rising of new world powers at the end of the 20th century and beginning of 21st century has challenged the US global domination. Washington s challenges with the new multipolar world order in recent years has resulted in the decline of US influence in the world, which is expected to be accelerated  withTrump s term in White House.Recognizing Al-Quds (Jerusalem) as Israeli regime s capital by Trump created lots of negative reaction and resulted in a resolution by the UN General Assembly despite the US threats   is a clear example of declining US global influence.Decline of US domination over world trade and financial regimesAfter the end of World WarII until 1960, the US held 40 percent of the world economy but after the rise of new economic powers like China, Japan and EU, in 2013 the US just held 25 percent of the world economy. Considering the recent decisions made by Trump to withdraw from TPP and NAFTA and tensions with EU, more decline is expected in near future.The Dollar dominated global financial, trade and banking regimes until the beginning of 21th century. The first blow to the dollar global stand was inflicted in 1999 when euro appeared as official currency of the EU. In recent years rise of Chinese renminbi has inflicted more blows to the dollar global stand, so that in 2015 only 50 to 60 percent of  world trades and transactions were done in dollar, according to EU central bank.During the past years, US sanctions against some countries like Russia, Iran and White House pressure on other countries to avoid transaction with these sanctioned countries, has resulted in some agreements between states to do their business in their own national currencies instead of dollar like the agreements between Iran, Russia, Turkey and China. Continuation of such agreements and trend will definitely lead to further decline of dollar global stand in future.Decline of the US strategic importance in terms of politics and militaryTrump s serious pressure on NATO   the most important strategic achievement of the US till now   with member states to pay more for the costs of the alliance, has inflicted serious damages to the solidarity of the member states and has created many doubts   so that some US old European allies are seriously after formation of a European Army.US inability to solve South Korea s missile and nuclear program issues despite Trump s rhetoric and bluffs, US inability to materialize its regional policy and plans in the Middle East to change the map of the region to the benefit of its own strategic interest and Israel s due to close cooperation of Iran, Russia, Turkey, Iraq and Syria   all these US failures and its wrong policies which have even forced some of its old regional allies like Turkey to recalibrate its relation and cooperation with White House in the region   shows the US limitations and incapability resulting in increasing decline of Washington s influence.Also the US inability to settle the issues in east of Ukraine and Crimea as its European allies expected has been a serious blow to its strategic stand among the Washington s European allies, and even worse nowadays as some of the Europeans consider US measures in east Europe as a blackmailing to gain the energy market of the EuropeDuring the last one year in office, Trump s moves to withdraw from Paris Climate Change accord, TPP, his wrong approach toward the nuclear deal with Iran (JCPOA), his insatiable immigration policy which has resulted in significant reduction in the number of foreign students in US for the first time, and finally his partial recognition of Al-Quds as Israeli regime s capital   all have inflicted serious blows to global credibility and influence of the country which cannot be at least mended in short-term.READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"December 29, 2017",0

Clinton lost her temper and called the president by his first name in an emotionally driven break with White House decorum, according to the book. What I want for you to do is call off your f king dogs, Barack!

21020,Brazil prosecutor says new audio threatens Batista leniency deal,"A leniency deal struck between the controlling shareholders of Brazilian meatpacker JBS SA and prosecutors may be partially revoked, threatening witnesses  immunity but keeping their testimony, the country s top prosecutor said on Monday. Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot said at a news conference that billionaire meat tycoon Joesley Batista and a fellow state s witness seemed to have inadvertently recorded a four-hour conversation discussing crimes not covered in their plea bargain. The audio was submitted to prosecutors on Thursday as an attachment to an unrelated matter, he said. Joesley Batista and his brother Wesley previously confessed to bribing scores of politicians in plea bargain testimony that allowed them to avoid prosecution. With their help, prosecutors got a recording of President Michel Temer apparently endorsing hush payments to a possible witness in a graft probe. Janot said the new audio was  very troubling  because it suggested the Batistas had not been forthcoming about all of their crimes. He also said the audio implicated someone at the Supreme Court of unspecified wrongdoing and suggested that a prosecutor in his office had aided the Batistas illegally. Janot said evidence from their plea bargain testimony, which he has used to bring corruption charges against Temer, will stand regardless of whether witnesses lose immunity after an investigation of the new audio. The prosecutor general is expected to bring a second wave of charges against Temer in coming weeks. Questions about the Batistas  testimony are likely to hang over the charges against Temer, making it easier for members of Congress to prevent the president from facing trial at the Supreme Court, as they did with earlier charges. Temer declined to comment on the matter when asked by reporters in China. J&F Investimentos SA, the holding company through which the Batista family controls JBS, said Janot had hastily interpreted the recording, which contained  considerations of hypotheses  and did not compromise the good faith of the witnesses. The company agreed in May to pay a leniency fine of 10.3 billion reais ($3.3 billion) for its role in a political bribery scheme. Since then, Joesley Batista resigned as chairman of JBS, but his brother Wesley remains chief executive and has been fighting efforts to remove him led by state development bank BNDES, another major shareholder in the world s largest meatpacker. Janot opened an investigation on Monday into revising the leniency deals of Joesley Batista and two other J&F executives, according to a document on his office s website. Since the plea deal, J&F has been racing to sell assets in order to reduce debt and pay the leniency fine. In three months, the holding company has signed agreements to sell Havaianas flip-flops maker Alpargatas SA, dairy company Vigor Alimentos SA and pulpmaker Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA.

18642,China says U.S. should respect concerns on Taiwan,"The United States must respect China s concerns on Taiwan to avoid causing disturbances in Sino-U.S. ties, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told visiting U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Saturday. China considers democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is the island s main source of arms. China regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States, and has been upset by U.S. moves to expand military exchanges with Taiwan and continued U.S. arms sales to the island. Wang explained China s position on the Taiwan issue and  demanded the U.S. side earnestly respect China s concerns, appropriately handle the relevant issue and avoid bringing disturbances to China-U.S. relations , China s Foreign Ministry said. It did not elaborate. Beijing s relationship with Taiwan has been frosty since President Tsai Ing-wen won election on the island by a landslide last year. China suspects that Tsai, who leads the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China. In recent months the Chinese air force has conducted a series of drills around Taiwan, which have included bombers and advanced fighter jets, alarming Taipei. China has called the exercises routine and pledged to continue with them.",worldnews,"September 30, 2017 ",0
8117,"Ted Cruz Repeats Lie About SCOTUS Nominations, Vows To Block Anyone Obama Chooses (VIDEO)","After being embarrassed on live television Saturday night when John Dickerson fact-checked his lie about Supreme Court history, Ted Cruz showed no shame as he repeated the same line on Sunday.The GOP Debate started off on Saturday night with Dickerson asked Cruz about whether or not President Obama should be able to name a successor to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died earlier that day.Cruz claimed that a Supreme Court nominee named by a lame duck president has not been confirmed by the Senate in 80 years. Dickerson, however, pointed out that former President Ronald Reagan s nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy to the bench in 1987 was confirmed by the Senate in 1988, the final year of Reagan s presidency. Thus, Dickerson caught Cruz lying, which stunned the candidate into silence as the crowd booed the moderator for bringing up pesky facts.During an appearance on ABC s This Week, the Texas Senator told George Stephanopoulos the very same lie and then blamed Democrats as the reason why Kennedy was only confirmed in 1988, claiming that it would never have happened if they had just automatically confirmed universally despised nominee Robert Bork instead of rejecting him and his extremism. George, the Senate has not confirmed a nominee that was named in the final year, an election year, in 80 years. This is a lame duck president. And, by the way, the only reason Anthony Kennedy was nominated that late is that Democrats in the Senate had gone after and defeated two previous nominees, Robert Bork, which set a new standard for partisan attacks on a nominee, and Doug Ginsburg. So it was the Democrats that had dragged it out for many months to make it that late. And right now, the court is exquisitely balanced. The fact is, however, that there is a process to Supreme Court nominations and confirmations. Many presidents have had their nominees rejected by the Senate, so it s not like Reagan was the first to have a nominee fail to be confirmed. The bottom line is that Cruz is still wrong on his Supreme Court history.But Cruz wasn t done. Upon being asked if he would filibuster anyone President Obama nominates to fill Scalia s seat, Cruz replied  Absolutely,  and said that the people should decide who fills the seat by electing the next president. This should be a decision for the people, George. We ve got an election. And, you know, Democrats   I cannot wait to stand on that stage with Hillary Clinton or with Bernie Sanders and take the case to the people, what vision of the Supreme Court do you want? Let the election decide it. If the Democrats want to replace this nominee, they need to win the election. Here s the video via ABC. ABC Breaking News | Latest News VideosThis is a particularly hard argument to make since Americans elected President Obama for a full four year second term in 2012 by five million votes. President Obama has nearly a full year left in office, so it is absolutely absurd, not to mention an admission that Republican will refuse to do their constitutional duty, to suggest that President Obama should force America to wait a full year or more before the Supreme Court is functioning with a full nine member bench again. President Obama earned the right to nominate a Supreme Court Justice when he won the 2012 Election. Ted Cruz and his Republican comrades need to get over it and do their damn jobs.

6358,U.S. farmers ask Trump to stay the course on Cuba,"Dozens of U.S. farm and agri-business groups on Thursday urged President-elect Donald Trump to build upon progress made by the Obama administration in relations with Cuba, calling trade with the former Cold War foe particularly important at a time of a severe downturn in farm incomes. The agricultural trade groups stated their views in a letter sent to Trump, who is to be inaugurated on Jan. 20. “As a broad cross-section of rural America, we urge you not to take steps to reverse progress made in normalizing relations with Cuba, but also solicit your support for the agricultural business sector to expand trade with Cuba,” the letter said. “It’s time to put the 17 million American jobs associated with agriculture ahead of a few hardline politicians in Washington,” the letter concluded. Signatories included a wide range of agricultural trade groups, from the American Farm Bureau and American Feed Industry Association to the soy bean, corn, rice, wheat, peas, beans, cattle, poultry lobbies and other associations The letter was arranged by the Washington-based Engage Cuba Coalition and USA Rice. Agricultural organizations in states that Trump won, such as Idaho, Alabama and Georgia, were also signatories. Trump, a Republican, has said he will dismantle the still fragile detente begun by President Barack Obama two years ago unless Cuba gives the United States a better deal, while providing no specifics. The letter was sent before the White House announced on Thursday that it was ending a policy that granted residency to Cubans who arrived in the United States without visas, the latest bid by Obama to make his Cuba policy irreversible. Trump is expected to review the Cuba engagement upon taking office and has named Jason Greenblatt, a Trump Organization executive and chief legal counsel, as negotiator for sensitive international issues, including Cuba. Under an exception to the U.S. trade embargo from the year 2000, Cuba may import agricultural products for cash. The letter calls on Trump to allow normal trade financing and credit so the sector can better compete for the Cuban market. While the sector has sold billions of dollars in products to Cuba over the years, the letter said sales have steadily declined as the embargo makes it difficult to compete with other suppliers. Cuba imports some $2 billion in food annually. The signatories cited a deep dip in farm income to bolster their argument that U.S. farmers needed more trade. “Net farm income is down 46 percent from just three years ago, constituting the largest three-year drop since the start of the Great Depression,” the letter said.",politicsNews,"January 12, 2017 ",0
19281,"China's ruling party expels anti-graft, ex-insurance officials citing graft","China s ruling Communist Party has expelled the nation s former top insurance regulator and the head of the finance ministry s anti-graft committee after an anti-corruption watchdog said investigations found serious violations of party discipline. In a statement on its website on Saturday, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said an investigation had determined that Xiang Junbo, former chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), had  committed serious violations of political discipline and rules  in order to serve personal political interests. The statement also said Xiang was suspected of bribery and accused him of  engaging in superstitious activities , an allegation often levelled at discredited officials to further  tarnish their names. President Xi Jinping has presided over a far-reaching anti-corruption drive since coming to power in late 2012, punishing more than a million party members, jailing top military figures and retired security tsar Zhou Yongkang, the most senior official toppled for corruption since 1949. China s top leaders have also pledged this year to address financial risks and asset bubbles, ahead of a once-every-five-years congress of the Communist Party which will start on Oct. 18.  Xiang will be handed over to legal authorities, the statement added, meaning he will be prosecuted. Xiang, who also served as a member of the central bank s monetary policy committee, was removed from his position in April for suspected  serious disciplinary violations , a phrase that usually refers to graft. He is the most senior financial regulator to be targeted by the Chinese government s ongoing fight against graft. As head of the insurance regulator, Xiang oversaw rapid growth of the insurance industry, along with liberalisation of investment rules that provided insurers greater latitude to invest more of their assets at home and overseas. Xiang was previously a deputy central bank governor and vice chief at the National Audit Office. Reuters was not able to reach Xiang or a family or legal representative for comment and it was unclear if he has been allowed to retain a lawyer. Mo Jiancheng, appointed the top graft buster at China s Ministry of Finance in December 2015, was also expelled from the party after an investigation found he had  seriously violated the spirit of political discipline , was suspected of bribery and had accepted numerous invitations to banquets, the CCDI statement said.

18427,Iraqi Kurds face more sanctions after calling elections,"Iraq s autonomous Kurdistan region announced on Tuesday it was calling presidential and parliamentary elections for Nov. 1 as the Kurdish leadership moved to capitalize on a referendum that delivered huge support for independence. The central government in Baghdad imposed further punitive measures in retaliation for the independence vote last month by slapping sanctions on Kurdish banks and halting foreign currency transfers to the Kurdish region.  The referendum in the country s Kurdish-held northern regions raised fears in Iraq and abroad of ethnic strains and a weakening of a U.S.-backed campaign against Islamic State. The elections would be calculated to reinforce the legitimacy of the Kurdish leadership before a drive for outright independence and any negotiations that might involve. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that his country would impose further sanctions on northern Iraq over the referendum. Powerful neighbors Ankara and Tehran fear it could fuel Kurdish separatism within their own borders. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has not declared independence. The November polls are for the parliament and presidency of the region, not for an independent state. Baghdad retaliated against the referendum with an international flights ban on Kurdish airports, while Iran and Turkey launched joint military exercises with Iraqi troops at their borders with Iraqi Kurdistan. The Shi ite Arab-led Iraqi government has rejected a KRG offer to discuss independence. It demanded Kurdish leaders cancel the result of the referendum or face continued sanctions, international isolation and possible military intervention. On Tuesday, Iraq s central bank told the KRG that it would no longer sell dollars to four leading Kurdish banks and would stop all foreign currency transfers to the region, banking and government sources told Reuters. Businesses in need of foreign currency and foreign workers, whose salaries are usually paid in dollars, will be hardest hit by the measure. The Iraqi dinar is not accepted outside the country.  In a further attempt to assert Baghdad s authority, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi called for a  joint administration  in the multi-ethnic northern city of Kirkuk and other areas claimed by his both his government and the KRG, provided that Baghdad held the top role in such an arrangement.         Earlier, the federal parliament in Baghdad raised the threat of excluding Kurdish members who took part in the referendum, on the basis that it was unconstitutional.  The parliament decided to collect the names of those who voted in the referendum as a step towards their impeachment by the Higher Federal Court, Speaker Salim al-Jabouri told a news conference after the session, boycotted by most Kurdish MPs. Jabouri said he was willing to open a dialogue with the KRG to resolve disputes but ruled out talks on independence. Masoud Barzani, the heir of a dynasty which has led a Kurdish struggle for independence for over a century, has held the KRG presidency since its establishment in 2005, two years after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.  Barzani s tenure was extended beyond his second term in 2013 as fresh turmoil engulfed the region and Islamic State overran about a third of Iraq the following year, threatening the Kurdish region. It was unclear whether Barzani would or could stand in the November poll as Kurdish law says a president cannot stay in office for more than two terms. Campaigning for the two elections will start on Oct. 15, the Kurdish Rudaw TV channel quoted the High Elections and Referendum Commission chief Hendrean Mohammed as saying. Islamic State s self-declared  caliphate  effectively collapsed in July, when the group s stronghold in Mosul, west of the KRG capital Erbil, fell to a U.S.-backed Iraqi offensive with the participation of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.The Kurds  push for independence is meant to capitalize on their contribution to the war on Islamic State.  The U.S. administration, which had strengthened its alliance with Iraq s Kurds, is taking Baghdad s side in the crisis by refusing to recognize the outcome of the referendum.  Iraqi and Kurdish media announced that former Iraqi president Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, had died on Tuesday in Germany at the age of 83. Talabani, a veteran leader of the Kurdish struggle for self-determination, stepped down as president in 2014, after a long period of treatment following a stroke in 2012. His wife and companion in political struggle, Hero, and his Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) party had voiced only lukewarm support for the referendum.",worldnews,"October 3, 2017 ",1

Or is it a family running the government? Is it Ivanka and Jared and the President sitting around in the White House upstairs ruling the world?ASHLEY PARKER: I don t think it s quite that but I think it is run like a family business. The president and his aides see it publicly and privately and the President s family, his children, especially his daughter Ivanka and, you know, Jared Kushner, they operate with a degree of impunity that does not exist for these other aides. So, if you look at just Jared and Tillerson, Jared basically emerged as a shadow Secretary of State. You mentioned peace in the Middle East. His portfolio includes not only that, it includes China, it includes Mexico, it includes Canada and that s just on the foreign policy front. So, if you re the secretary of state, ambassadors and leaders of foreign nations know that they can directly go to the President s son-in-law and have his ear that deeply undermines you and makes it really difficult for you to do your job.MATTHEWS: And then you find out in all these investigations that Jared was opening up a tunnel to Moscow so he wouldn t have to deal with the State Department. So the son-in-law   you know, one good thing Mussolini did was execute his son-in-law. I mean, I m talking about CianoFRANK BRUNI: Let s be careful here, yeah.Much like the vile and repulsive comments made by other leftists in the media or in Hollywood, Matthews disgusting remarks will be completely ignored by the media, as this type of hateful rhetoric has been deemed perfectly acceptable by their peers, as long as the hate is directed at President Trump, his family or his supporters, everything is fair game",left-news,"Jul 1, 2017",0

Obama s orchestrated efforts with race baiters like Al Sharpton and leaders of Black Lives Matter terrorists have created a divide between races like my generation has never known. Obama skips Supreme Court Justice Anton Scalia s funeral and the funeral  of iconic First Lady, Nancy Reagan, but finds time to take a few pot shots at GOP presidential front-runner, Donald Trump while attending a hipster festival with Michelle. Barack s proven over and over he doesn t have the time or desire to behave like a leader, and now, he s going to tell the Europeans what they need to do as it relates to the EU? When I heard from the Baron today that our current president is planning to go to Britain to make a case to the public for staying in the European Union, I was momentarily stunned. What happened to  leading from behind  and letting other countries handle their own affairs?By now we re all jaded by this president. He does nothing for free, nothing in which there is not some eventual pay-off to him. So sticking his nose into Britain s affairs should come as no surprise, given his track record of the last interminable years of his time in office.Or maybe he doesn t know how deeply disliked he is by anyone who didn t sign onto his pathetic  Peace Prize  back in the beginning of his reign? Maybe he believes what the sycophantic press tells him? Or  or  wait! Is he using a kind of reverse psychology on the British   i.e., knowing how much he is held in contempt, anything he suggests, they would oppose? Nah he s far too removed from reality to grasp that concept.So here we have London Mayor Boris Johnson s take on the subject. He s far more interesting to follow on this than any national government figures would be. Via: Gates Of ViennaThese excerpts are from The Telegraph. The only thing Mr J got wrong is the extent to which Obama has undermined America s sovereignty, particularly at our southern border and on the subject of changing our culture and monolingual character. One could say that Mr. Obama s decision to drop in and lecture the Brits on this particular subject is not contradictory at all; it is congruent with his own behavior and sentiments regarding America s sovereignty.Obviously, Mr. Johnson hasn t been paying attention to the American presidential campaign. But they why would he? Had he done so, though, he d have seen an unprecedented populist following for Donald Trump, based on that theme: sovereignty.We want ours back in one piece.I love America. I believe in the American dream. Indeed, I hold that the story of the past 100 years has been very largely about how America rose to global greatness   and how America has helped to preserve and expand democracy around the world. In two global conflicts, and throughout the Cold War, the United States has fought for the founding ideals of the republic: that government of the people, by the people, for the people should not perish from the earth.So it is on the face of it a bit peculiar that U.S. government officials should believe that Britain must remain within the EU   a system in which democracy is increasingly undermined.Some time in the next couple of months we are told that President Obama himself is going to arrive in this country, like some deus ex machina, to pronounce on the matter. Air Force One will touch down; a lectern with the presidential seal will be erected. The British people will be told to be good to themselves, to do the right thing. We will be informed by our most important ally that it is in our interests to stay in the EU, no matter how flawed we may feel that organisation to be. Never mind the loss of sovereignty; never mind the expense and the bureaucracy and the uncontrolled immigration.The American view is very clear. Whether in code or en clair, the President will tell us all that UK membership of the EU is right for Britain, right for Europe, and right for America. And why? Because that   or so we will be told   is the only way we can have  influence  in the counsels of the nations.It is an important argument, and deserves to be taken seriously. I also think it is wholly fallacious   and coming from Uncle Sam, it is a piece of outrageous and exorbitant hypocrisy.There is no country in the world that defends its own sovereignty with such hysterical vigilance as the United States of America. This is a nation born from its glorious refusal to accept overseas control. Almost two and a half centuries ago the American colonists rose up and violently asserted the principle that they   and they alone   should determine the government of America, and not George III or his ministers. To this day the Americans refuse to kneel to almost any kind of international jurisdiction. Alone of Western nations, the US declines to accept that its citizens can be subject to the rulings of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. They have not even signed up to the Convention on the Law of the Sea. Can you imagine the Americans submitting their democracy to the kind of regime that we have in the EU?So why is it essential for Britain to comply with a system that the Americans would themselves reject out of hand?

You know that Muslims are not friends with pigs,  he said.But Swedish religious experts have been quick to criticize the campaigners.

17854,4 EASY TO UNDERSTAND REASONS My Ancestors Are NOT The Same as Illegals Who Come To America Today,"How many times have liberals used the argument that  everyone s relatives came here illegally!  ? The answer is about a million or more times. Liberals can t seem to differentiate between people who came to our nation to either escape persecution or to find a better life that came through Ellis Island or immediately applied for citizenship in America, and those who float across the Rio Grande on an inner-tube after paying a coyote a fee to help them illegally cross our borders.This meme brilliantly explains the difference in 4 short bullet points.:Here s a little visual for anyone who tells you #4 isn t true:It is estimated that 12.5 million illegal aliens are currently living in the United States.Below, are a series of visuals from the Federation for American Immigration Reform or FAIR to help Americans to understand the cost of illegal immigration to taxpaying Americans. This data from September 27, 2017, paints a pretty bleak economic picture for America if we continue to ignore the serious problem of illegal immigration:   FAIR   At the federal, state, and local levels, taxpayers shell out approximately $134.9 billion to cover the costs incurred by the presence of more than 12.5 million illegal aliens, and about 4.2 million citizen children of illegal aliens. That amounts to a tax burden of approximately $8,075 per illegal alien family member and a total of $115,894,597,664. The total cost of illegal immigration to U.S. taxpayers is both staggering and crippling. In 2013, FAIR estimated the total cost to be approximately $113 billion. So, in under four years, the cost has risen nearly $3 billion. This is a disturbing and unsustainable trend.",left-news,"Oct 5, 2017",0
18457,University of Nairobi closed as anger rises over police brutality,"Administrators closed Kenya s oldest university on Tuesday, citing fears for students  safety in a planned protest over police beatings at a campus demonstration last week. Kenyan police frequently face accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings from civilians and rights groups, but officers are rarely charged and almost never convicted.  Despite this, Kenya, an economic and transport hub in East Africa and a key Western ally in a volatile region, receives substantial financial support for its security services from international donors, including the United States and Britain.   Rights groups say at least 28 people were killed, mostly by police, in unrest following the Aug. 8 election, whose results were later nullified by the Supreme Court due to irregularities.  A re-run of the presidential vote is scheduled for Oct. 26 and the conduct of the police will be closely watched.

Trump and congressional Republicans campaigned on a promise to dismantle Obamacare, and they are working on carrying out that pledge as an early product of united Republican control of the White House and Congress. But the legislative proposal by Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana would let states choose to keep Obamacare or move to a replacement program, for which states would also receive some federal funding. Cassidy, himself a doctor, said such an approach could help attract Democratic votes that will be needed for an eventual replacement for Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s health insurance program approved in 2010. The proposal did not, however, win over the Senate’s leading Democrat, Chuck Schumer, who denounced the idea as an “empty facade” and a “far cry” from a full replacement for Obamacare. Democrats strongly oppose a repeal of Obamacare, officially called the Affordable Care Act. But after a meeting Monday of congressional leaders and Trump, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said Democrats were willing to discuss Republican healthcare proposals if they accomplish the same goals. “Well, we talked about the Affordable Care Act, and said, what the Affordable Care Act has been successful in doing is improving quality, expanding access and lowering costs. And any proposal that they might have that does that – we’d be interested in hearing about,” Pelosi said after the meeting at the White House. At the Republican news conference earlier, Collins called Trump’s executive order issued Friday against Obamacare “very confusing,” adding that whatever actions the Trump administration takes, legislation will still be needed to replace the law. “We really don’t know yet what the impact will be,” Collins, a moderate Republican, said, adding that it will be difficult to assess the order’s impact until there is a new Cabinet secretary in place in charge of health. Trump signed his executive order on Friday within hours of taking office. It directs U.S. agencies to “waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation” of provisions of Obamacare deemed to impose fiscal burdens on states, companies or individuals. The order did not specify which parts of Obamacare would be affected or the timing. Trump’s nominee to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Representative Tom Price of Georgia, has said there is no plan for “pulling the rug out” on millions of Americans’ healthcare as a replacement is designed. Any changes are unlikely to affect in 2017 the government-funded or subsidized insurance plans covering more than 20 million people.",politicsNews,"January 23, 2017 ",1

20382,Factbox: Norway's close-fought election for parliament,"Norwegians vote on Sept. 10 and 11 to pick a parliament for the next four years and determine whether the center-right minority government stays in power or is replaced by parties on the center-left. Opinion polls show the election remains too close to call. Exit polls and forecasts based on early votes will be made public on Monday at 1900 GMT, and most ballots will be counted within three to four hours. In the case of an exceptionally tight race however, the final result may not emerge until late on Tuesday. Below is a summary of key policy differences and the dynamics of the race: All 169 seats in parliament are up for grabs, and as many as nine parties are expected to win seats under Norway s system of proportional representation. However, there are only two candidates for the job of prime minister - the incumbent Erna Solberg of the Conservatives and Labour s Jonas Gahr Stoere. A calculation by www.pollofpolls.no, measuring the average of September opinion polls, gave Solberg s four-party block 85 seats, just enough for a majority, while the four on the center-left, plus the independent Green Party, would win 84 seats. But whether it s the center-left or center-right that hits the crucial 85 seats, the winner faces tricky post-election negotiations and will meet tough demands from small parties to keep their support over the next four years. The race could be decided by how many of the small parties clear the key four-percent hurdle that gives access to a pool of so-called  seats at large , boosting their presence in parliament. Two parties on the right, two on the left and one in the center, the Greens, are all close to this key threshold. Solberg seeks further cuts in personal income tax and a reduction of the wealth tax, but has declined to say by how much. She requires backing from the centrist Liberals and Christian Democrats, which would temper the size of any cuts. Labour has vowed to raise taxes for above-average earners and the wealthy by up to $2 billion to improve public services and reduce the reliance on cash from Norway s sovereign wealth fund. Citing concerns over climate change and potential pollution, several small parties seek to limit the expansion of Norway s oil and gas industry, which brings in almost half the country s export revenues. The independent Greens, which could hold the balance of power in post-election maneuvers, have made it a condition for anyone seeking their support to end all exploration   a demand that neither Labour nor the Conservatives are willing to meet. Meanwhile, the Liberal Party hopes to slow down the awards of new exploration acreage to oil firms if the Conservatives stay in power, while on the left the Reds and the Socialist Left will make similar demands of a Labour-led government. The seas surrounding the arctic Lofoten archipelago could thus remain off-limits to the oil industry, while the extent of drilling in the far-north Barents Sea may emerge as a flash-point in post-election negotiations. With nearly $1 trillion saved up from Norway s extensive oil and gas industry, the next parliament faces key questions over how to organize the fund and whether to allow investments beyond the foreign stocks, bonds and real estate it currently holds. Decisions are mostly made in consensus between the bigger parties, however, and neither Labour nor the Conservatives have said whether they agree with a recent report that suggested it should no longer be managed by the central bank. If Labour s Gahr Stoere emerges as the likely next prime minister, he will face pressure from center-left parties to review EU-outsider Norway s extensive inclusion in the European Union s single market. At stake is Norway s participation in the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty, strongly favored by both Labour and the Conservatives but opposed by the euro-skeptic Centre Party (CP) and the Socialist Left (SL). However, both the CP and the SL, in government with Labour from 2005 to 2013, agreed at the time to govern on the basis of the EEA.

2244,Oklahoma Supreme Court rules fee on cigarettes unconstitutional,"Oklahoma’s Supreme Court declared a fee on cigarettes unconstitutional on Thursday, citing faulty lawmaking practices, prompting the state’s governor to suggest calling back the legislature to find a solution to replace the lost revenue. In a statement following the court’s decision, Republican Governor Mary Fallin said invalidating the fee would cause a $215 million budget shortfall. Most of the revenue created by the passage in May of the “cessation” fee - $1.50 per pack of cigarettes - was earmarked for health and human services agencies. “These agencies and the people they serve cannot sustain the kind of cuts that will occur if we do not find a solution,” Fallin said. “My belief is we will have to come into special session to address this issue.” The court called the fee a “revenue raising measure” that was passed in violation of the state’s legislative process that requires that such measures cannot be passed in the last five days of a session. The measure also did not garner either a required supermajority vote in favor, or a vote by the people to pass. Lawmakers were attempting to fill an $878 million shortfall.  A special session would cost the state an additional $30,000 per day, according to a statement released Thursday by the House Democratic Caucus. Petitioners, which included both tobacco and wholesale distribution companies, argued that the fee was a revenue-raising measure. Attorneys representing the state said the principle purpose of the fee was not to raise revenue, saying that it primarily aimed at reducing smoking rates, and therefore did not have to follow the constitutional process. Oklahoma has a balanced budget requirement. Its fiscal-year 2018 budget totaled about $6.8 billion, according to Michael McNutt, a spokesman for Fallin. The yield on Oklahoma 10-year general obligation bonds traded 20 basis points over the benchmark Thomson Reuters Municipal Market Data AAA yield scale on Wednesday, according to the data available. The yield was little changed from the end of May, when the state’s legislative session ended.",politicsNews,"August 10, 2017 ",1
22539,"CASTING CRISIS: Orlando’s Actors, Agents and Casualty Role Players","Shawn Helton 21st Century WireTruth is often stranger than fiction when looking at the bizarre phenomena surrounding many mass casualty incidents   and the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting was no exception.It was recently revealed that the world s largest security firm G4S, who had employed the man named in the Orlando pulse nightclub shooting, Omar Mateen  is a client of the mass casualty staging company called CrisisCast.  STAGING REALITY    CrisisCast specializes in replicating mass casualty events. (Screen Capture from Crisis Cast)Training for DisasterThe heavily-stylized company CrisisCast, appears to be a revamped version of the Visionbox Crisis Actors project (a crisis actor production emerging after Sandy Hook), with a professional team of actors, elaborate film crews, expert producers and theatrical effects makeup squads mimicking real-life injuries (additional prosthetics)   all focused to deliver a simulated crisis-like reality to the public, later to be managed accordingly through their public relations division via various forms of social media.RELATED: (VIDEO)  Active Shooter  and  Terror  Drills: The Truth WILL Shock YouIn CrisisCast s  about  section we see a sophisticated amalgam of emergency protocol disaster training combined with  internationally credited film crews,  that bring their high-end stagecraft to life, through a collection of  role players, stunts, medical simulations and combat flashpoints, cloaked in visual tricky, with film techniques out of the UK and Australia, so says the group s website.Below is a road traffic collusion demo created by lead CrisisCast producer/founder Brian Mitchell (has worked on Hollywood studios and holds National security clearance) featured on Vimeo. The scenario is filmed from multiple angles, with quick cut editing that disorients, as we see an individual (crisis actor) in the aftermath of a crash   struck by the emotional weight of the scene   screaming out to a gaggle of onlookers after witnessing the staged carnage. The strange episode leaves one with a feeling of phantom trauma that continues to lurk.When recreating large scale mass casualty incidents, Cast may also make use of  pyrotechnics, wardrobe, special effects, covert and aerial footage,  depending on the clients needs.In a passage from their  solutions  section, an outline to basic formatting for a simulated crisis is revealed: Our producers work with your trainers to create a  script  that enables the role play actors to know when to trigger key developments in an evolving crisis management scenario. We brief and rehearse the team   where possible on location   but at least with video surveillance footage.Heads of department manage each discipline and report to the lead producer who is your direct contact at all times. In addition to stage-managing a crisis scenario with a highly fluid production team, Cast also centers its strategy on  lockdown and evacuation procedures, [with] the ability of emergency services to co-operate,   and the ever important task of having the  joint ability to respond to the press,  in a partnership with the company s clients through a multitude of social media platforms on the internet. The  crowdsourcing  techniques employed by Visionbox Crisis Actors comes to mind.  OUR CRISIS    A promotional shot from CrisisCast s website featuring a riot scene in London. (Image Scource: crisiscast) Nothing works as effectively in dealing with real-world disasters as rehearsal.    CrisisCastAlso note worthy, Cast states, it has the ability to create  highly credible, dramatic scenarios to bear preparing your people for the worst, employing both  psychological and practical tools,  in their disaster training   all the while making sure that role playing actors, as well as crew have signed non-disclosure agreements (NDA s) before each scripted event. Here s another passage depicting the kind of psychological implementation used to achieve a successful Cast simulation: Our role play actors are psychologically trained in criminal and victim behaviour. They bring intense realism to simulated mass casualty incidents on the battlefield, during kidnap and ransom and emergency evacuation situations and in hostile threat incidents in urban or public places.In so doing, CrisisCast provides learners with an irrevocable first encounter with the emotional challenges of any hostile incident. Other clients of Cast include The London City Airport and UK Trade & Investment, along with many other leading companies worldwide. From CrisisCast to Hollywood Also featured on Cast s website, Francesca Hunt (Professional actress and lead producer and co-founder of CrisisCast), explaining why  authentic  stress behaviors are so important when recreating a crisis. . According unitedagents.co.uk, Hunt herself is a theater trained actress, having studied at Oxford (1983-86) graduate, Bristol Old Vic (1987-89) and Moscow Arts Theatre 1989. She has been featured in several Hollywood films such as  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Strathblair (1992) and A Prince Among Men (1997) on her IMDB page.  The page also states she is married to Brian (Mitchell?, CrisisCast Founder?).

In the YouTube clip below, the intricate dynamics within a staged crisis are witnessed when  fictional  European countries are pitted against one another during riot-scene training with the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland (3 SCOTS)   The video mentions the UN s involvement as well   could this kind of  training  also be used under a modern day Operation GLADIO?

Most notably, a short interview in a major Hollywood designer documentary called The Big Fix in 2012, discussing the BP oil spill at Deep Water Horizon.Mateen at the 36 minute mark, played the part of a concerned security guard, taking on a scripted activist-type character revealing that  everybody is out to get paid,  and that  they want more disaster to happen, cuz that s where there money making is  even though he was currently working for the world s largest security contractor overseeing the apparent environmental crisis.Indeed, Mateen was also featured in another documentary called Love City Jalalabad (2013), a feature supposedly depicting progressive Afghani youth and a quest for social change, created by the abstract artist/filmmaker George Gittoes, whose works delve into the holographic and hyperreal, as he was also said to be a former collaborator with the famed screen print legend Andy Warhol and holographic pioneer physicist Zoltan Hegedus (hat-tip 21WIRE contributor Randy Johnson).Gittoes has a background in politically charged propaganda films, with him  [Creating a] series of works including The Hotel Kennedy Suite and The Kent State Suite responding to events in the United States, including anti-Vietnam War protests and the Kent State shootings at Kent State University, Ohio,  in 1970.Additionally, during a time of great upheaval, Gittoes  [traveled] to Bosnia (April May) on a privately sponsored trip to document United Nations- monitored elections. Produces series of paintings based on the people of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and documents the effects of the 1992 96 Bosnian War for independence, the longest siege of a city in the history of modern warfare. Gittoes then traveled to Iraq four times between March 2003 and May 2004, making a trilogy of films based on The War On Terror.Comparatively, in an article written by Jay Dyer of Jay s Analysis we re reminded of other connections with intelligence agencies and Hollywood. Here s a passage where Dyer observes historical links between the CIA and Hollywood, through the former CIA general counsel: Author John Rizzo has recently published a book titled Company Man: Thirty Years of Controversy and Crisis in the CIA, which is an amazing admission of this scandalous affair between intelligence and the film industry.  The L.A. Times comments: The CIA has long had a special relationship with the entertainment industry, devoting considerable attention to fostering relationships with Hollywood movers and shakers studio executives, producers, directors, big-name actors,  John Rizzo, the former acting CIA general counsel, wrote in his new book,  Company Man: Thirty Years of Crisis and Controversy in the CIA.The CIA also recruits actors to give more visibility to propaganda projects abroad, such as a documentary secretly produced by the agency, Rizzo said. And the agency sometimes takes advantage of the door-opening cachet that movie stars and other American celebrities enjoy. A star who met a world leader, for example, might be asked for details about that meeting.The CIA has officials assigned full-time to the care and feeding of Hollywood assets, Rizzo wrote.  Other former CIA officials added that some of those operatives work in the Los Angeles office of an agency department called the National Resources Division, which recruits people in the U.S. to help America spy abroad. Through the connections above, were also reminded of the alleged Orlando shooter s father, Seddique Mateen, who is closely tied to some of the most powerful leaders and agencies in Washington DC. Here s a passage from a recent 21WIRE report discussing a deeper intelligence connection with the Mateen family: Omar Mateen, worked as a contractor for the US Department of Homeland Security, then we learned that the elder Mateen is also standing to run for President of Afghanistan and is allied with the Taliban leadership   an absolutely ideal profile for a Washington-managed, CIA controlled-opposition political candidate. SEE ALSO: Father of Orlando Shooter is Long-time CIA AssetWhat is the public to make of Mateen s own acting and film background as it relates to America s largest mass shooting   are we again seeing a clear link between Hollywood and military/security services?Was the Orlando shooting also a production of sorts?The theatrical aspects of this event, as depicted in the media over the last 6 days   are so pervasive and over-the-top that one might easily conclude that there is much more at play than a lone gunman and a  saddened but resilient community determined to overcome this senseless and horrific tragedy.

As Seen on TV : Orlando s Acting Professionals Additionally, there was a Pulse nightclub goer seen immediately making the media rounds on TV following the dramatic shooting event, one Luis Burbano, an actor/model featured in a few Hollywood films, according to his IMDB bio.Here s a YouTube clip featuring Burbano s media appearance   One of the Orlando shooting survivors has admitted to locking an exit door, putting dozens of revelers  lives at risk during the massacre.The revelations about Luis Burbano s actions the night of the shooting have come to light after he gave an interview, saying he  regrets  his second chance at life.Nearby, he saw people moving through a small  employee s only  door hidden behind a curtain, and followed after. On the other side of the door was a narrow hallway where Burbano estimates about 20 people were crawling over each other to get to the exit at the other end. Burbano says he decided to shut the door behind him because the hallway was getting dangerously overcrowded. Here s another out-of-town Pulse club goer, Shawn Royster Santiago, from New York City, who apparently witnessed the shooting and who also happens to have a media/acting and modeling pedigree as well.According to Santiago s ModelMayhem profile it states, [I ve been] modeling and performing in the entertainment industry off and on since i was 11,  having appeared in a variety of projects such as Television/Commercials,  and he currently works as a  Visual Merchandiser.  Watch him in the news clip below shortly after the Orlando shooting attack Additionally, the YouTube video montages another interview with the professional actor and model named Luis Burbano, where he  admits  was blocking an exit at the time of the shooting The media linked personality, Patience Carter, from Philadelphia, PA, has also caused many to ask questions. Watch this YouTube clip from Now the Truth, to see her role in the Orlando story  Here s a review of some previously covered anomalies here at 21WIRE As we previously reported, though the Orlando shooting attack was officially stated to have been carried out around 2am, The Daily Mail published Facebook posts from people apparently inside the club that contradict the main timeline, suggesting the shooting happened much earlier.Here are the Facebook comments featured in the Daily Mail  for review If these time stamps are correct and the posts have not been doctored in any way, then these posts present a pretty major crack in the official timeline of events at Pulse nightclub.Here s another clip with the animated YouTube personality Peekay Truth outlining the Daily Mail time discrepancy associated with the Orlando shooting The UK s Independent published an article displaying an eyewitness account that directly contradicts the lone gunman theory pushed by all major media outlets in the aftermath of the shooting: Police did not immediately name the gunman or provide a possible motive for the attack but officials have classified the rampage as a  domestic terrorism incident , Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said.Javer Antonetti, 53, told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper he was near the back of the dance club when he heard gunfire.  There were so many (shots), at least 40,  he said.  I saw two guys and it was constant, like  pow, pow, pow, . From a logistical stand point Mateen s ability to carry out the shooting by himself seems to be another questionable aspect to an increasingly troubled case.Another club eyewitness Jon Alamo,  heard 20, 40, 50 shots, and then  The music stopped. While the stress of the incident could account for some differences, forensically it s hard to believe Mateen would have been able to have the ability to shoot over hundred people with only 50 some shots.According to multiple eyewitness accounts people inside the club mentioned that there was possibly as many as four shooters in and around the area. The witness seen in the image just below described the following: Then he [Mateen] called someone he knew and he mentioned that he was the fourth shooter, and there were three others. One of the main mainstream media protagonists from the Orlando Shooting event was a man named Chris Hansen, an aspiring actor and entertainer who played a central role as  survivor  and  hero  in a number of heavily rotated media clips depicting the aftermath of the event.

Fake Trauma & Staged Casualty Drills Back in March, 21WIRE also covered the suspicious Brussels airport attack, that coincidentally revealed a host of inter-agency mass casualty drills taking place on the global stage: In October of 2015, SputnikNews reported massive NATO drills in Belgium and other member countries: On October 21, the largest NATO military exercises in 13 years moved into an active phase testing threat response. The drills involve over 36,000 troops from 30 NATO and partner countries. The first phase of the Trident Juncture drills began October 3, running for two weeks in Canada, Norway, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The second part is taking place in southern Europe   Spain, Italy, and Portugal   as well as in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Similarly, in February, The Daily Mail published an article reporting  Europe s largest-ever disaster response training exercise : Police, firefighters and paramedics will this week work side-by-side with more than 70 partner agencies including local councils, utility companies and specialist search and rescue teams to respond to the disaster during the four-day drill.Disaster victim identification teams from all UK police regions are also working alongside other forensic specialists in a mortuary on site.Teams will also be working alongside firefighters from Italy, Hungary and Cyprus who will also be mobilised to the incident on Wednesday.Although this scenario is not a terrorist attack, we will be practising procedures and systems that are common to any emergency that results in a large number of fatalities and injuries.

Guess how many people besides the rally s organizers showed up? ONE. Yep, you read that right. Only one person showed up to the hate rally, when originally there was going to be a supposed 200 people in attendance.

10065,Senator Grassley to meet Garland despite opposition to nominee,"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has invited Judge Merrick Garland to breakfast, but absent from the menu will be any promise of hearings on President Barack Obama’s nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. A spokeswoman for Grassley said that the Republican senator spoke with Garland late on Monday and extended the invitation “where they could discuss the nomination and why the Senate will not consider a nominee until the next president takes office.” The Senate Judiciary Committee is in charge of holding hearings on Supreme Court nominees chosen by the president and deciding whether to recommend full Senate confirmation. Most of the Senate’s 54 Republicans have indicated opposition to confirming any high-court nominee of Obama’s, saying the choice should be made by the next president, who would be elected on Nov. 8 and sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. Despite the wall of Republican opposition to Garland, who is considered a moderate federal appeals court judge, Obama and his fellow Democrats continue to push for Senate confirmation this year. Garland already has made several “courtesy calls” to senators, mostly Democrats, and will continue his visits to Capitol Hill this week. If he were to be confirmed, Garland - nominated to fill the vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia - would tilt the Supreme Court to the left for the first time in decades. The race for a replacement for Obama, who is completing his second and final term as president, is in full swing now with billionaire businessman Donald Trump leading two other Republican candidates and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. But it could be weeks or months before the two political parties settle on their respective candidates. A date for the breakfast meeting has not yet been set, Grassley’s spokeswoman said.",politicsNews,"April 4, 2016 ",1
22231,"Uber, Google, Twitter, Netflix and Other Tech Giants File ‘Unlawful’ Immigration Retort Against Trump","21st Century Wire says A group of top Silicon Valley tech companies have filed a rare legal brief stating Trump Administration s Executive Order on immigration is discriminatory and  departs dramatically from the principles that have governed our immigration law for decades. This legal filing follows the report Friday when a Federal Judge issued a temporarily restraining order blocking US Border Patrol, Customs and Immigration Services from enforcing President Trump s recent executive order, which bars entry to the U.S. to anyone coming from seven  majority Muslim  countries.This story and the leaked text of the legal challenge was a Washington Post exclusive on Sunday . Elizabeth Dwoskin Washington PostSilicon Valley is stepping up its confrontation with the Trump administration.On Sunday night, Google, Facebook, Uber, Twitter, Netflix and other prominent tech companies are planning to file legal brief opposing the administration s contentious entry ban, according to people familiar with the matter.The amicus brief is expected to be filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which is expected to rule within a few days on an appeal by the administration after a federal judge in Seattle issued late Friday a temporary restraining order putting the entry ban on hold. The brief comes at the end of a week of nationwide protests against the plan   as well as a flurry of activity in Silicon Valley, a region that sees immigration as central to its identity as an innovation hub.Companies backing the filing also include Pinterest, Yelp, Square, Reddit, Kickstarter, Github, Glassdoor, Box, Mozilla, Dropbox, Twilio, Zynga, Medium, Pinterest, and Salesforce, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the filing was still being finalized Sunday.Notably, it doesn t appear that Apple, Amazon, or Microsoft are party to the brief. The sources cautioned that the wording of the brief   and the participants   could still change before the filing is made Sunday night.A draft of the filing says that the entry ban, which barred individuals from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. for at least 90 days and suspended the U.S. refugee program, is discriminatory. The Order effects a sudden, seismic shift in the rules governing entry into the United States, and it departs dramatically from the principles that have governed our immigration law for decades,  a draft obtained by The Washington Post reads.  The Order discriminates on the basis of national origin and religion. It closes our borders to the world s most vulnerable people, such as those fleeing the devastation of war. And it establishes discretionary and arbitrary rules for admission to this country, even by immigrants who have lived here lawfully for years.

408,Another Pervert Out At Fox News Over Allegations Of Sexual Harassment,"Fox News has a problem with sexual predators in its ranks. Their gross corporate rape culture is costing them television personalities left and right. First, it was the now-deceased mastermind behind the network, Roger Ailes. Then it was Bill O Reilly (who was, by all accounts, their main star) who had to be canned to save the network s brand after millions were paid to his victims. Now, it is happening again   only this time it is Eric Bolling.Bolling had his own program, called The Specialists, which was relatively new, but he had been with the network for a decade. Fox News released a curt statement that read: Fox News Channel is canceling The Specialists, and Eric Bolling and Fox have agreed to part ways amicably. We thank Eric for his ten years of service to our loyal viewers and wish him the best of luck. There was no mention of the sexual harassment charges, but that was clearly the reason. Bolling has been accused of sending lewd photos of penises to female Fox News employees. Bolling, for his part, is, of course, denying the allegations. His lawyer released a statement that reads: Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made. This all comes on the heels of Bolling being suspended after Yashar Ali of the Huffington Post came out with an explosive report regarding Bolling s conduct in the workplace. Bolling is filing a $50 million lawsuit against Yashar for character defamation. It likely won t go anywhere as no one in their right mind would write such a story without concrete evidence.That network of right-wing propaganda needs to go down the toilet with the rest of the sewage. They are misogynistic, racist, and all around bigoted to their core. They are also pathological liars who should not be allowed to call themselves  news. So long, Bolling. Hopefully the rest of that vile network follows.Featured image via Logopedia",News,"September 8, 2017",0
934,Paul Manafort’s Daughters Say Their Father Is Guilty Of Mass Murder In Leaked Text Messages,"Leaked text messages between the daughters of Paul Manafort, who served as Donald Trump s campaign manager until his Russian ties came back to bite him in the rear, reveal that they believe their father committed mass murder in the Ukraine.Manafort has conceded that his daughter s phones were hacked and roughly 300,000 messages were leaked. There is no way to describe the conversations between Andrea and Jessica other than downright chilling. Don t fool yourself,  Andrea wrote to her sister, according to Business Insider.  That money we have is blood money. You know he has killed people in Ukraine? Knowingly,  she continued.  As a tactic to outrage the world and get focus on Ukraine. Remember when there were all those deaths taking place. A while back. About a year ago. Revolts and what not. Do you know whose strategy that was to cause that, to send those people out and get them slaughtered. In later messages between Andrea and her cousin, Collin Bond, she also revealed that Manafort s marriage was in trouble, but a  public divorce  was not an option because Manafort had  too many skeletons  and  his work and payment in Ukraine is legally questionable. He is a sick f ing tyrant,  Andrea said to Bond regarding her father.  And we keep showing up and dancing for him.   We just keep showing up and eating the lobster. Nothing changes. In their texts, his daughters also discussed Manafort s relationship with Donald Trump. Politico reports:In one exchange, daughter Jessica Manafort writes  Im not a trump supporter but i am still proud of dad tho. He is the best at what he does.  Her sister Andrea Manafort responded by referring to their father s relationship with Trump as  The most dangerous friendship in America,  while in another exchange she called them  a perfect pair  of  power-hungry egomaniacs,  and asserted  the only reason my dad is doing this campaign is for sport. He likes the challenge. It s like an egomaniac s chess game. There s no money motivation. Manafort has a long history of working for murderous dictators with zero f*cks to give about those who suffer the ultimate consequences. Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Ukraine s Viktor Yanukovych, and Zaire s Mobutu Sese Seko are all on Manafort s resume. And apparently, his family is completely aware of who this man really is   and so is Trump.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"July 5, 2017",1
8912,Jeb Bush Blames Bad Parenting For Black Crime: Says His Own Kids’ Crimes ‘Not His Fault’ (VIDEO),"Earlier this year, Presidential hopeful Jeb Bush was asked a question regarding domestic protests in Baltimore and Ferguson, which were tied to predatory policing of African-Americans that led to murder-by-cop.Via Think Progress:During a Q & A with employees of the pharmaceutical company Nephron, his response to a question about teachers  unions veered into his thoughts on the origins of the mass protests in Ferguson and Baltimore. Kids in this country are aimlessly wandering around in their lives because they ve never been told they were capable of learning,  Bush said.  They ve never been challenged to achieve far better. They ve never really had the kind of mentoring and nurturing that gives them the sense their lives could be better. You see what happens in Baltimore and Ferguson. You see the tragedies play out. You see people becoming so despondent they take actions that are horrific. Jeb is   with a slightly softer wording than some   using the same old white privilege-ridden Republican response to criminal issues that are a part of the African-American community   blame the parents.Fast forward 7 months later:During an interview with CBS Miami, the topic of Jeb s daughter Noelle came up. Jeb was asked by the interviewer about his daughter s criminal past and multiple issues with drugs. The interviewer specifically asked if Jeb felt that during his time away from home campaigning and during his tenure as Governor,  if he didn t have enough time for his family   and if that made him feel personally responsible for his daughter s problems.Listen to Jeb s incredibly hypocritical response in the video below via CBS Miami:  I can t blame myself. That s not gonna solve any problems, and you just can t do that. Jeb can t blame himself for choosing not to be around for his family when his daughter was engaging in criminal drug activity. However, as you saw above, if you are black and live in a city that means it s YOUR family s fault if you engage in any immoral or illegal activity.Here is some history on Jeb s daughter. In 2002, Noelle was arrested when she tried to forge a Xanax prescription in Tallahassee. A judge sentenced her to rehab. In July 2002, she was jailed for three days for violating her probation by breaking the rules of her rehab program. In October 2002, Noelle was jailed again for 10 more days when she was found in possession of crack cocaine while in the rehab center. In 2003, she finally completed the program and has had a cushy job at one of daddy s companies ever since.These are 3 crimes that were drug related in less than one year. She spent less thantwo weeks in jail total for all of it.It s relevant to know that during Jeb s first year as Florida governor he signed a law increasing mandatory minimums for drug offenses and for minors, including a 3-year minimum for as little as 4 grams of heroin. He also blocked the implementation of  treatment instead of jail  for nonviolent drug offenses. Bush also opposed a ballot measure that would have allowed 10,000 drug offenders to leave jail and enroll in treatment programs. Somehow Jeb s daughter avoided this mandatory minimum sentencing minefield.One final bit of annoyance Jeb s son George P. Bush was also arrested for breaking and entering his ex-girlfriend s home while drunk when he was 18 years old. He walked when charges were not pressed.What an elitist Republican jerk   Jeb Bush really showed his capacity for hypocrisy and contempt for other people by excusing himself for his families problems, while laying ALL the problems African-American people encounter in life squarely on their parents  shoulders.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 7, 2016",0
9539,Trump has a history of questionable behavior with women: NY Times,"Interviews with dozens of women who have worked for Donald Trump or interacted with him socially reveal a pattern of often unsettling personal behavior by the Republican presidential candidate, The New York Times reported on Saturday.  The Times, which said it based the article on more than 50 interviews, quoted women who recounted episodes in which he treated women as sexual objects and made comments about their bodies. But some women said Trump had encouraged them in their careers and promoted them within his businesses, often in positions in which women tended to be excluded. When asked about the unflattering incidents described in the article, Trump either denied that they took place or disputed the details, the newspaper said. “A lot of things get made up over the years,” Trump told the Times. “I have always treated women with great respect.” A Trump representative did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment. Barbara Res, who oversaw construction of Trump’s Manhattan business headquarters, said he would sometimes interrupt meetings with comments about women’s figures.  During a job interview for a Los Angeles project, for example, Trump made a random aside about Southern California women. “They take care of their asses,” Res recalled Trump saying. Years later, when Res says she had gained weight, she said Trump told her: “You like your candy.” Even so, Res, who worked for Trump for 12 years before quitting and then came back as a consultant for six more, said she was grateful to Trump for her professional opportunities, though she said he frequently called her “Honey Bunch,” the Times reported.   Trump also earned a reputation for being seen with beautiful women dating back to his days at a New York military-style boarding school where he was named “ladies’ man” in the yearbook, the Times reported.   Barbara Fife, a deputy New York mayor in the 1990s, recalls Trump telling her at her City Hall office that he was in a hurry because he had “a great date tonight with a model for Victoria’s Secret,” she told the Times. “I saw it as immature, quite honestly,” Fife was quoted as saying. As a candidate, Trump has made frequent references to his record in business as evidence of how American women would benefit if he is elected. He has often said that no one “cherishes” or “respects” women more than him.        Some of those interviewed praised Trump for giving women positions of power. “I think there are mischaracterizations about him,” Jill Martin, assistant counsel at the Trump Organization, told the Times. “For me, he’s made it a situation where I can really excel at my job and still devote the time necessary for my family.” The story comes less than two weeks after the last of Trump’s Republican rivals dropped out, all but assuring him the party’s presidential nomination this summer.  Throughout his improbable campaign, Trump has managed to deflect criticism about his attitude to women, fueled by verbal insults he lobbed at Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and former Republican candidate Carly Fiorina.",politicsNews,"May 14, 2016 ",1

7600,GOP Senator Threatens To Ruin Career Of Anyone Who Accepts Obama SCOTUS Nomination,"Senate Republicans sink to a new disgraceful low in their childish effort prevent President Obama from filling the vacant Supreme Court seat.When asked about potential Supreme Court nominees, John Cornyn, the second highest ranking Republican in the Senate literally issued a threat to anyone who might accept the nomination from President Obama that their career and reputation will be intentionally ruined by Senate Republicans. I think they will bear some resemblance to a pi ata,  Cornyn said according to CNN. What I don t understand is how someone who actually wants to be confirmed to the Supreme Court would actually allow themselves to be used by the administration in a political fight that s going to last from now until the end of the year. Because there is no guarantee, certainly, after that time they re going to look as good as they did going in. Yes, Senate Republicans are so desperate to get their way that they are willing to destroy the life of anyone President Obama nominates to fill the empty Supreme Court seat even if that person has impeccable credentials and is absolutely qualified to do the job.This angered Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid so much that he entered the CNN article into the Congressional Record, where it will remain as an example of just how petulant Republicans have become, and then he took to the Senate floor to blast Cornyn and the GOP. Think about that. They don t know who the nominee is, they don t know anything about the person, but they already have in their mind they are going to beat this person like a pi ata. It doesn t matter who it is. Man, woman, old, young, it doesn t matter. Doesn t matter what their education is, what their experience is, they re going to beat them like a pi ata. I think they ve been listening to Donald Trump too much. The Republicans need to stop and listen to this disgusting rhetoric they re spewing This is vile behavior that is beneath the dignity of this institution.  Here s the video of Reid remarks via YouTube:And the American people overwhelmingly agree with Democrats on this issue.Three major polls, including a Fox News poll, reveal that most Americans WANT President Obama to nominate a replacement for Scalia and they WANT Senate Republicans to do their jobs and hold fair confirmation hearings even more. A Rasmussen poll says the same thing, and so does a CNN/ORC poll released this month.But rather than backtrack his remarks and apologize for his utter lack of professionalism, Cornyn doubled down on his threat and this time used the Senate floor to repeat his offensive promise to destroy the reputation and career of anyone who accepts the nomination, suggesting that President Obama would be at fault if Senate Republicans did such a thing. I would be surprised if any person who actually aspired to be on the United States Supreme Court, a current judge or a legal scholar or lawyer, would allow themselves to be used by this administration in making a nomination to the Supreme Court for a seat that will not be filled during the remainder of President Obama s term. Knowing that they won t be confirmed. This is totally outrageous and Senate Republicans should be ashamed of themselves. They have thumbed their nose at the American people and are an embarrassment to the nation and Constitution they claim to serve.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"March 9, 2016",0

Paul also said he would move to align the Senate bill, which eliminates the state and local tax deduction, to match language in the rival House of Representatives’ bill that only partially repeals the deduction.

6292,Trump's Commerce pick Wilbur Ross is no stranger to protectionism,"When billionaire investor Wilbur Ross salvaged two North Carolina textile mills from bankruptcy in 2003 and 2004, one of the first things he did was head to Washington to immerse himself in trade law and policy. China’s accession to the World Trade Organization had unleashed a flood of textile imports across U.S. borders, and Ross - now President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for commerce secretary - took an unusual hands-on approach, advocating for “safeguard” tariffs to help the ravaged domestic industry. “He was not the first outside investor to come into the industry and buy a major asset. He was the first and to my knowledge only major outside investor who took on that same sort of attitude that the more home-grown CEOs had,” said Auggie Tantillo, who has lobbied for textile makers in Washington for almost 40 years. Ross’ history owning and defending embattled steel and textile manufacturing companies that have relied on border duties to protect their industries means he will bring a unique approach to the commerce secretary job, departing from the traditional role of cheerleading for free trade and big business. In a questionnaire ahead of a U.S. Senate hearing to review his nomination - which had been slated for Thursday - Ross said he had owned or had a significant stake in more than 100 businesses over 55 years. Forbes has estimated his fortune at $2.9 billion. Ross has not yet provided the Senate with financial disclosures or an ethics agreement to prevent conflicts of interest. Late on Tuesday, the Senate Commerce Committee said it would postpone Ross’ hearing until Jan. 18 to give more time to ethics officials to do their work. Ross is one of three wealthy Trump picks to run into delays with the vetting process. Education nominee Betsy DeVos and Labor pick Andrew Pudzer have also had their Senate hearings pushed back. The Economist has called Ross “Mr. Protectionism,” a term Ross told CNBC he saw as “pejorative” and inaccurate because he said the threat of tariffs would be a used as a negotiating tool. If confirmed, Ross, 79, who is personally close to Trump, will be a lead player shaping U.S. trade policy, working alongside Robert Lighthizer, a lawyer known for his work with beleaguered U.S. manufacturers whom Trump has tapped as U.S. trade representative, and Peter Navarro, an economist and China hawk who will serve as a White House adviser. Free trade advocates worry the Trump trade triumvirate will be too quick to use tariffs to keep imports out, raising costs for manufacturers that rely on imported parts - or even sparking retaliatory trade wars. “The three of them - those guys put together - can create a lot of mischief,” said Dan Ikenson, a longtime trade policy economist now with the Cato Institute think tank. Ross did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Trump’s transition team said Ross would draw on his experience “saving and creating” manufacturing jobs if confirmed, and would push to expand exports and reduce imports. Ross has worked with allies in labor unions and other industry groups hurt by imports to push for tariffs and quotas, even starting his own coalition in 2003. Although the coalition was short-lived, Ross’s trade rhetoric about the trade deficit and currency manipulation has remained consistent - and was echoed on the campaign trail by Trump. Ross called the 20-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada the “poster child for unbalanced trade and investment,” in a letter to The Wall Street Journal. He has accused Mexico of importing auto parts from China for vehicles it shipped duty-free into the United States. But his companies have also produced goods in Mexico. The 2007 annual report for his International Textile Group called NAFTA “advantageous to the company” because of its factories there. Ross supported the Central America Free Trade Agreement, saying he believed it fixed some of what he saw as loopholes in NAFTA. Ross has drawn an unusual endorsement - from the United Steelworkers union, which backed Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, in the election. Leo Gerard, president of the USW, said in an interview last month that Trump’s team understood that trade remedy laws themselves needed to be modernized to make it easier to impose sanctions and duties before industries are hurt and jobs are lost. “We have a lot of suggestions for when there’s a new trade team,” Gerard told Reuters.",politicsNews,"January 10, 2017 ",1

Increasingly, she s being asked to explain how food stamps may impact immigration status, if not to outright cancel family food benefits.Since mid-January, five of Fortin s families have withdrawn from the SNAP program. One, the single mother of three citizen daughters, had fled to Georgia to escape an abusive husband. Another, two green-card holders with four young children, were thinking of taking on third jobs to compensate for the lost benefits. These families represent a small fraction of Fortin s caseload   she estimates she has signed 200 immigrant families up for SNAP over the past six months   but based on the calls she gets from other clients, she fears more cancellations are imminent. I get calls from concerned parents all the time:  should I take my kids out of the program?  Fortin said.  They re risking hunger out of fear   and my heart just breaks for them. Chattanooga is not an outlier here, either.In the two months since President Trump s inauguration, food banks and hunger advocates around the country have noted a decline in the number of eligible immigrants applying for SNAP   and an uptick in immigrants seeking to withdraw from the program.WAPO GOES ON TO DISPLAY A VIDEO WITH A PHOTO OF STATS ON ILLEGALS IN THE U.S.: Thanks to the WashPo for writing a story that intends to highlight the  terrible  Trump administration   but instead shows us that people who ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LIVING HERE are not only living here illegally   but also (until now) have felt free to take the taxpayer-funded benefits   that we were assured by liberals that they weren t getting!

4409,Ex-U.S. Attorney Bharara takes aim at Trump with criticism and jokes,"Former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara took several shots at the administration of President Donald Trump on Thursday, calling for “facts not falsehoods” as the basis for political discourse and a more welcoming stance towards immigrants in his first public speaking event since being fired one month ago. Bharara sprinkled the hour-long speech with humor, including a joke about the size of the crowd clearly aimed at Trump. But Bharara also made a series of thinly veiled criticisms of the new administration, referring multiple times to Trump’s campaign pledge to “drain the swamp” in Washington. “You don’t drain a swamp with a slogan. You don’t drain it by replacing one set of partisans with another. You don’t replace muck with muck,” Bharara, 48, said at the Cooper Union in New York.  “To drain a swamp you need an army corps of engineers, experts schooled in service and serious purpose. Not do-nothing, say-anything, neophyte opportunists who know a lot about how to bully and bluster but not so much about truth, justice and fairness.”  Bharara was fired by Trump on March 11 after refusing to step down. While he was among 46 U.S. attorneys told to submit their resignations, his dismissal was a surprise because Trump had asked him in November to stay in the job. Bharara has said it was not made clear to him at first whether or not he was being dismissed. He joked about that initial confusion with a reference to Trump’s TV reality show in which he regularly fired people on the spot. “I don’t really understand why this was such a big deal, especially to this White House. I had thought that was what Donald Trump was good at,” Bharara said.  As the chief federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, Bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white-collar criminal cases, as well as cases involving national security. He said he was equally proud of the less high-profile work his office did to combat gangs and consumer fraud. Bharara said he expected his successor to carry on with the office’s reputation for independence. He did not comment on who his possible successor. As for his own future, Bharara ruled out running for public office. “I don’t have any plans to enter politics just like I have no plans to join the circus. And I mean no offence to the circus.”",politicsNews,"April 7, 2017 ",0
18770,EU's Verhofstadt pokes fun at British PM May but says a Brexit deal can be done,"The lead Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament poked fun at British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday, quipping that she gave her Brexit speech in Florence because she was familiar with the city s 15th century politics of betrayal. In a speech to students at the London School of Economics, Guy Verhofstadt said Brexit was negative and a waste of time and energy, though he also said Britain s decision to leave the bloc was a failure for the European Union.  I think she chose Florence because Florentine politics in the 15th century made her feel at home,  Verhofstadt said with a smile.  Backstabbing, betrayal, noble families fighting for power... It is an environment that she recognized fairly well.  He said the one positive outcome of Brexit was that the mood in the EU had reversed since Britain s vote to leave in June 2016 and that now many EU citizens did not want to destroy the Union. After May formally notified the EU in March of Britain s intention to leave the EU, the two sides have about a year left to negotiate the terms of the divorce and the outlines of the future relationship before it is due to leave in March 2019.  Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world s biggest trading bloc and the fifth largest global economy, though some chief executives and diplomats fear what they term a disorderly Brexit without a deal. May had hoped that a speech she made in Florence on Friday would unblock the three-month-old talks and pave the way for the EU to open discussions on a post-Brexit free trade deal.  The EU and Britain made progress in the latest round of divorce talks, but not enough to move to the next phase of discussions on a transition period after Brexit or a future trade deal, top negotiators said on Thursday. When Verhofstadt was asked whether he thought a deal could ultimately be done on Brexit, he said:  That s the assumption that I have and it is towards that that we work.   And that a withdrawal agreement be done in March 2019 means that there has to be an agreement in fact in October or November because then the agreement will go to the European Parliament and we need four or five months,  he said.  After what he termed the  failure  of Brexit, Verhofstadt said the EU needed a major overhaul to give the euro zone a government with its own fiscal capacity and its own treasury and finance minister.  We need a management or government of this euro zone with a fiscal capacity, that is in my view the most important. And with a fiscal capacity, normally, you can also give out loans,  he said, adding that some type of euro securities could be issued at some point in the future.",worldnews,"September 28, 2017 ",0

I deserved the criticism,  said Linton, who was likened to Marie Antoinette and Cruela de Vil after her social media meltdown. Her outburst came after Jennifer Miller, a working mother with three children, called Linton  deplorable  in the comment section of an Instagram photo she posted of her and Mnuchin deboarding a government plane on August 21 following a trip to Kentucky.The couple will be reimbursing the feds for the flight to Kentucky Remember that President Trump said he wanted a rich person in positions such as Commerce and Treasury:Read more: DM",politics,"Sep 5, 2017",0
6766,Trump STUNS Republican Voter By Straight-Up Telling Her That He WILL Deport Her Family (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has figured out that the more offensive, controversial and vulgar he is, the more conservative voters are going to love him. He s carried that tone throughout his entire campaign, and has only seemed to rise in the polls. Now, he s focusing on offending individual Republican voters to win their approval.During a Today Show town hall event on Thursday morning, undecided Republican voter Jamie Eckman asked The Donald a question that would impact many Americans: would he deport the undocumented parents of a relative that was a natural-born citizen relative? Eckman asked: My relative is a natural-born American in the military, deployed in Oman. His father and stepmother are undocumented citizens here in the   undocumented people here in the United States for the last 25 years without any way of adjusting their status. If you re president, what will you do for those members that are the fabric of our country, that have been here for 25 years undocumented? Won t they be deported? Once again, Trump nailed his formula of being an absolute a**hole and despicable human being. After taking a few moments to insult his rival, Canadian-born Ted Cruz, Trump returned to the matter at hand and answered Eckman s question with something she probably didn t want to hear: Yes, your loved ones are still getting deported. Trump said: When you say natural-born citizens, that s interesting. I assume you were born here. Why do you mention that? Because you know who always says that? Ted Cruz. He was born in Canada and lived there for four years. He says,  I m a natural-born citizen  when, actually he was born in Canada. But, you know what? He has no path right now.. Eckman quickly clarified that she wasn t on team Cruz before Trump continued to tell Eckman she could kiss her family goodbye if he became the next President. They ve been here how many years? We re going to do something. For people that have been   look, we re either going to have a country or we re not going to have a country. But many people are very fine people. and I m sure these are very, very fine people. They re going to go, and we re going to create a path where we can get them into this country legally, okay? But it has to be done legally. Taken aback that she didn t get the answer she was looking for, Eckman asked the Republican front runner,  You will deport them first, right?  Trump responded: They re going to go, and then come back and come back legally. We have wonderful people. It s too tough to say you ll never come back again. They re coming back, but they re coming back into our country legally. So important. And to prove just how disgusting and heartless he is, Trump added,  Now that might not be the perfect answer for you, but am I going to get your vote?  Eckman didn t answer.You can watch Trump break this Republican voter s heart below:Despite all of the backlash he s faced, Trump continues to cling to his racist, intolerant immigration stance. It seems that unless Eckman wants to be packing her relatives  bags in November, she d better vote for Hillary Clinton. But unfortunately, because Republicans just aren t very bright, Trump might still get her vote. Featured image via screenshots",News,"April 22, 2016",1

10991,Connecticut's governor says no return to pre-recession prosperity,"Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy delivered a downbeat address on Wednesday, outlining plans to slash government spending and admitting to “a visceral feeling” that there was no going back to the prosperity of pre-recession years. The short and somber address came on the heels of a presentation by Malloy’s top budget official, who called for $570 million of reductions next year on top of millions in cuts and tax hikes in previous years. “Our national economy, while making progress from the Great Recession, was fundamentally changed,” Malloy, a Democrat, said at his annual state of the state address. “A shifting workforce, the rapid rise of technology, and stagnant wage growth have made this recovery tougher for everyone, everywhere.” Connecticut has consistently lagged the national economic recovery and has been hit by job losses in its key financial and high-tech manufacturing industries.  The state has one of the worst funded pension systems in the nation. With required payments set to balloon to $6 billion by 2032, the system presents a significant risk to the budget. “Connecticut is not going back to that pre-recession reality,” Malloy told the Democrat-dominated legislature. “It just doesn’t exist anymore.” Connecticut’s woes show how U.S. states have shared unevenly in the recovery since the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Andrew Cuomo, governor of neighboring New York, felt confident enough to tout a $100 billion infrastructure plan in January. “It’s been a really hard recovery,” said Douglas Offerman, an analyst at Fitch Ratings. “The old paradigm that you would exceed your past peak in every expansion doesn’t appear to be holding right now.” Ben Barnes, Malloy’s top budget official, said the replacement of higher-paying jobs with lower- and middle-wage positions had been a “major story” in Connecticut’s budget ills.  Barnes proposed cuts of 5.75 percent to the budgets of state agencies, which could mean the elimination of several thousand jobs. He said cuts to discretionary spending would amount to 15 percent over two years.  At the start of the legislative session, Malloy urged lawmakers to pass an early budget and not wait until the last day of the fiscal year on June 30. But he said he would not circumvent the process. The governor proposed overhauling the way the state runs its budget to bring the process more in line with revenue projections, shifting away from a “current services” model. He also said lawmakers should implement a spending cap.",politicsNews,"February 3, 2016 ",1
78,Republicans seek to question FBI officials in Clinton probe: letter,"Two Republican lawmakers told the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday that they want to question three senior FBI officials about an investigation of then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state. The lawmakers, who are leading a joint probe into the Clinton investigation, said in a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, that they wanted to speak with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, FBI Chief of Staff Jim Rybicki and FBI counsel Lisa Page beginning on Thursday. The FBI declined to comment on the letter and referred reporters to the Justice Department. The request to meet the FBI officials for “transcribed interviews” was made after Republicans obtained more than 300 text messages sent last year between Page and FBI agent Peter Strzok critical of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The text messages called him an “idiot” and “a loathsome human,” among other things, according to copies reviewed by Reuters. Strzok later worked for Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the U.S. election and ties between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Moscow denies U.S. allegations of election meddling and Trump denies any campaign collusion.  Strzok, who helped lead the investigation of Clinton’s handling of classified material, was removed from Mueller’s team after the special counsel became aware of the texts critical of Trump. Republican lawmakers have attacked Mueller, expressing concern about potential bias among his investigators. But Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has testified to lawmakers that  he was “not aware” of any impropriety by Mueller’s team. Representative Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Representative Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, are conducting a joint review of the FBI’s handling of the Clinton investigation. In their letter to Sessions and Rosenstein, they said they were looking into several decisions by the FBI during the Clinton investigation, including then-FBI Director James Comey’s decision not refer Clinton’s case for prosecution.",politicsNews,"December 20, 2017 ",0

This had wannabe online detectives going nuts and analyzing the photos, which lead to the #HillarysBodyDouble hashtag being created on Twitter   and who else would love to jump on this bandwagon more than Donald Trump lover Scott Baio?!Baio, who has had it out for Clinton for some time, did his best to further the conspiracy theory, and got a bit of karma in the process. Not only did Baio fail miserably in making Clinton look bad, but he managed to make HIMSELF look like a complete dumba** in the process.

4204,Meet The Cowardly Republicans Who Re-Endorsed Trump After Condemning Him For Sexual Assault,"Republicans everywhere have been denouncing Trump for his boasts about sexually assaulting women, but it seems that they can t stick to their guns. In a very cowardly move, four Republicans have re-endorsed him, one has knuckled under and stayed quiet, and more are sure to follow both of these leads. These weak-kneed, spineless rat turds are busy putting party over country, and it s disgusting.First up: Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska. She made her position clear on the radio shortly after the worst weekend Trump has ever had. As a woman, there is no way she should still support him, and yet, she does for some sick reason: Well, like most Nebraskans, I am fully committed to defeating Hillary Clinton. I support the Republican ticket and I plan to vote for Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence on November 8th. She went on to say that she d never said she wouldn t vote for the GOP ticket, which is likely true, but smacks of making excuses. All she s done is show that beating Hillary is more important than the very real danger of legitimizing sexual crimes, and making a predator into a role model for our children. Giving in to that ideology is the move of a coward.Senator John Thune of South Dakota is next. He tweeted that Trump should withdraw and Mike Pence should take over. Now, though? He s caved like the chickenshit he is, too. He said: He has a lot of work to do, I think, to win this election. But I m certainly not going to vote for Hillary Clinton. So vote for Evan McMullin   at least he s respectable, knowledgeable and sane, unlike Trump and his minions.New Jersey Congressman Scott Garrett said that he felt Mike Pence was a better candidate than Trump following Trump s unmasking as a sexual predator. However, Garrett s campaign has since said that he still feels Trump is the best candidate to lead our country. His spokesman said, in part: Donald Trump remains the nominee of the Republican Party, and Rep. Garrett has always said he will vote for the Republican Party nominee. Scott Garrett s top priority in this election is stopping the Clinton-Gottheimer agenda of higher taxes, more wasteful spending, and weak national security policy. All important issues, but dismissing half the electorate by essentially saying,  Sure, we care about you, but your problems with sexual assault are just not that important,  right now is clueless and vile. It s typical sexism, actually.In fourth place, but tied for first, is Congressman Bradley Byrne of Alabama. We probably shouldn t be surprised that an official from Alabama would decide to support Trump, though, even after sixteen straight months of rotting vomit spewing forth from his mouth. Byrne was one of the first officials in Alabama to call on Trump to step down, but apparently, that s all changed now that it s been a week since Trump s  hot mic  tape was released.Byrne s spokesman, Seth Burrow, said: He will support the Republican ticket on Election Day, as he has pledged to do all along. He just believes that person should be Mike Pence. He just believes that person should be Mike Pence,  is one of the worst cop-outs in the long, sad history of bad cop-outs.And last, but certainly not least, is Paul Ryan. While he has refused to campaign with Trump anymore, and even disinvited him to an event in Wisconsin, he s got an extraordinarily flimsy position on Trump now. He won t talk about Trump, and he seems to be urging people to just kind of forget about Trump s Twitter storms and other problems.No mention of Trump being a sexual predator, which is unbelievably hypocritical for someone as  Christian  as Paul Ryan. To be sure, Ryan never rescinded his endorsement of Trump, and apparently, that position has not changed. It s still sick.More Republicans are sure to follow as they decide their party is more important than actually standing for what s right. They are bloody pieces of feces-infused wimpiness for that, considering they keep trumpeting every type of  moral value  there is.Photo of Deb Fischer by Mark Wilson, photo of John Thune by Alex Wong, photo of Scott Garrett by Chip Somodevilla, Photo of Paul Ryan by Win McNamee, via Getty Images.

Losing Hultqvist, one of the government s most popular ministers, would have been a blow to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, with Sweden due to hold elections in just a year s time. Other parties can still go ahead with a vote, but they would not get the majority necessary to oust him.  Lofven has already replaced two ministers in his minority center-left government over the IT deal, and the opposition had also demanded the removal of Hultqvist, who has maintained he has done nothing wrong.  However, the Liberals and the Center Party have now changed their minds, saying new information showed Hultqvist s involvement was not as serious as previously thought.   This new information means that we can t support a vote of no confidence,  Liberal Party Leader Jan Bjorklund told a news conference. Votes of no confidence are not common in Sweden.

2299,Illinois fights potential hike in disabled care funding,"Illinois fought on Friday against a potential court order it contends could cost the state, which just ended an unprecedented budget impasse, as much as an additional $1 billion annually to care for developmentally disabled people. In arguments before U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman, advocates for disabled people living outside of institutions said Illinois is violating a federal consent decree by failing to provide required services due to insufficient funding. The state maintained that even with the enactment last month of its first full budget in two years along with a tax hike, it still lacks enough money to pay off a more than $14 billion backlog in bills.   Additional funding to comply with the consent decree would have to be squeezed from existing spending on services for the developmentally disabled or from other unrelated programs, according to a court filing by the Illinois Attorney General’s Office. Brent Stratton, chief deputy Illinois Attorney General, told the judge the fiscal 2018 budget allocated $53 million for the first rate increase for developmentally disabled services since 2008. He said Illinois is in “substantial compliance” with the decree and that the funding boost should be allowed to play out. “The court has the power to enforce the consent decree, but there is a limit,” Stratton said. “The court can’t order us to increase rates.” Another U.S. judge ordered Illinois in June to increase payments to $586 million a month for Medicaid providers that were owed more than $3 billion for caring for poor and disabled residents covered under a separate federal consent decree. A stalemate between Illinois’ Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature left the nation’s fifth-largest state operating on spending ordered by courts and mandated by Illinois law for two-straight years. Lawyers for the developmentally disabled residents pointed to a $5 billion income rate increase Illinois enacted in July to bolster its sagging budget, saying that money could be tapped in the future to fund services.

Alkatiri, the secretary general of the Fretilin party, was East Timor s first prime minister after independence from Indonesia in 2002. He stood down in 2006 after a wave of unrest sparked by the sacking of 600 soldiers.  Today I announce to all the people that the president of the republic ... has nominated Dr. Mari Alkatiri to become the prime minister,  President Francisco  Lu Olo  Guterres told a news conference. Guterres called for people to remain calm and said Alkatiri would form a minority government. He expected Alkatiri s  swearing-in to be held either later on Thursday or on Friday.  The most important thing is the politicians need to think about how to maintain government stability in the future and ensure peace,  he said. Fretilin, or the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor, won the most votes in July s election but failed to get an outright majority. It intends to form a coalition with the small Democratic Party. It had been in a de facto coalition since 2015 with the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction, a party founded by former independence fighter Xanana Gusmao.  Alkatiri, who is a Muslim in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation, spent several decades living in exile in Mozambique during East Timor s struggle for independence. The next prime minister will face pressure to lift flagging oil production in the tiny nation of 1.3 million people, where unemployment and poverty remain high.  Dwindling output from existing oil and gas fields, compounded by the slumping prices of the commodities, have hit the government s budget and crimped its ambition to develop manufacturing as an engine for economic growth.  Australia and East Timor reached a breakthrough agreement earlier this month on a maritime border, ending a decade-old row that has stalled a $40 billion offshore gas project. The long-running dispute has led the owners of the Greater Sunrise fields - Woodside Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and Japan s Osaka Gas - to shelve the project.",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",0
14097,Canada data shows 10 percent of Haitian border crossers get refugee status,"Canada has granted refugee status to about 10 percent of the 298 Haitian border crossers whose applications have been processed this year, according to government data released on Wednesday.  That could bode ill for the 6,000 Haitians still in the refugee queue who illegally crossed the Canada-U.S. border by foot fearing that U.S. President Donald Trump would revoke their Temporary Protected Status.  And it may discourage more from illegally crossing into Canada after the U.S. government on Monday said it would end protected status for nearly 60,000 Haitians living in the United States in July 2019. Of the 298 Haitian applications processed so far this year, 68 were abandoned by the asylum seekers, which means they did not turn up for their hearings, the data released from the Immigration and Refugee Board showed. Another 62 withdrew their applications, according to the data from the quasi-judicial body whose tribunals determine refugee claims.  Montreal-based refugee lawyer Eric Taillefer said he thinks the Haitians who already made the border crossing did not understand Canadian laws on granting asylum.  They don t understand the evidence threshold, they don t understand, maybe, the definition of a refugee,  he said. The Canadian government has dispatched parliamentarians to talk to U.S. diaspora communities and dispel myths around Canada s immigration and refugee systems. Haiti-born politician Emmanuel Dubourg was in New York City this week. The high rates of abandoned claims could be because asylum seekers had trouble navigating the system and were not aware they needed to show up at a hearing, Taillefer said. Haitians are among some 17,000 asylum seekers who have walked across the border into Canada so far this year. Border crossers from other countries fared better, with 46 percent of Nigerian claims accepted, and 94 percent of Turkish people and 88 percent of Syrians approved. The stream of people crossing the border has eased since August, when there were hundreds each day, but Canadian authorities are planning for more people in the winter months.  The federal government is paying a Quebec company C$1.2 million to set up heated trailers to accommodate up to 200 people at a temporary encampment where asylum seekers have been staying while they await processing by the Canada Border Services Agency.",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",1
143,Factbox: Provisions of the U.S. Republicans' final tax bill,"Republicans in the U.S. Congress reached a deal on tax legislation on Wednesday, clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that, if approved, would be sent to President Donald Trump to sign into law. Formal language of the legislation, expected to add at least $1 trillion to the $20-trillion national debt over a decade, has not been released. The following are known provisions on which House of Representatives and Senate tax writers have agreed, based on conversations with aides and lawmakers: CORPORATE TAX RATE: Falls to 21 percent from 35 percent. The House and Senate bills, as well as Trump, had earlier proposed 20 percent. Going to 21 percent gave tax writers more federal revenue needed to allow the tax cut to take effect immediately. U.S. corporations have been seeking a large tax cut like this for many years.  PASS-THROUGH BUSINESSES: Creates a 20 percent business income deduction for owners of pass-through businesses, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships. The House had proposed a 25 percent tax rate; the Senate, a 23 percent deduction.  CORPORATE MINIMUM: Repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax, which was set up to ensure profitable companies pay at least some federal tax. CLEAN ENERGY: Maintains production tax credit for wind energy and the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. The House had proposed repealing the electric vehicle credit and scaling back the wind energy credit. The Senate version did neither. INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX RATES: There will be seven brackets, and the top rate falls to 37 percent from 39.6 percent. The House had proposed maintaining the 39.6 percent top rate and condensing the current seven tax brackets to four. The Senate had proposed cutting the top rate to 38.5 percent and maintaining seven brackets. PERMANENCE: The expectation is that individual tax rates will snap back to current levels in less than 10 years, possibly after 2024. The individual tax rates in the House bill were to be permanent. The individual tax rates in the Senate bill were to expire after 2025. STATE AND LOCAL TAX (SALT): Both the House and Senate had proposed scaling back the popular individual deduction for state and local tax payments by limiting it to property-tax payments and capping that at $10,000. The compromise bill will keep that $10,000 cap, but allow for continued deduction of both state and local income tax payments, as well as property tax payments. MORTGAGE INTEREST: Caps the mortgage interest deduction for new mortgages at $750,000 in home loan value, down from the current $1 million. The House had proposed a $500,000 cap. The Senate bill left it at $1 million. ESTATE TAX: Roughly doubles the exemption from the federal estate tax on inherited assets to about $11 million per person, or about $22 million per couple, but leaves the estate tax in place, mirroring the Senate proposal. The House bill had proposed entirely repealing the estate tax over several years. OBAMACARE MANDATE: Repeals a federal fine imposed on Americans under Obamacare for not obtaining health insurance coverage. The House bill did not repeal the Obamacare individual mandate.  ANWR DRILLING: Allows oil drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The provision was sponsored by Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2017 ",1

4596,Exclusive: Republicans mostly blame Congress for healthcare reform failure - Reuters/Ipsos poll,"Republicans mostly blame the U.S. Congress, and not President Donald Trump or party leaders, for failing to pass their party’s healthcare overhaul, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Wednesday.  The March 25-28 poll asked who should take responsibility for the failure of the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which Republican leaders pulled from consideration last week without a vote.  Besides Trump, who backed the bill, and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who was expected to shepherd it through Congress, the poll asked if people blamed House Republicans, House Democrats or the media.  Republicans were most likely to blame Congress. Some 26 percent said House Democrats were most responsible and 23 percent blamed House Republicans. Another 13 percent blamed Trump and 10 percent blamed Ryan. Only 8 percent blamed the media.   Their assessment appeared to align with Trump’s criticism of Democratic leaders and the conservative Freedom Caucus, whom he blamed for the bill’s failure.  Overall, nearly one in four Americans, including Democrats and independents, blamed Trump. Ryan, Congress and the media received less criticism.  The Republican reform was widely criticized after estimates by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office showed 24 million people could lose their health insurance over the next 10 years.  Trump said on Tuesday he still thinks healthcare reform can happen “very quickly” in Washington, but he did not offer any specifics on how it could get done, or what would be changed from the previous bill.  Nearly half of all Americans said they would like to see that happen, though the response was split along party lines. Some 80 percent of Republicans said they would like to see their party take another swing at a bill, compared with only 25 percent of Democrats.  In a separate poll conducted between Jan.7-23, 46 percent of Americans wanted to keep Obamacare, the popular name for President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform, while fixing “problem areas,” and another 8 percent wanted to keep it exactly as it is.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. The March 25-28 poll included 1,332 people, including 456 Republicans and 558 Democrats. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 percentage points for Democrats and Republicans.   (Reporting by Chris Kahn, editing by Ross Colvin)",politicsNews,"March 29, 2017 ",1
185,John Lewis Has the PERFECT Birthday Message For Hillary And Trump Will Be FURIOUS (TWEET),"Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) is a civil rights icon. He took beatings in the infamous Bloody Sunday massacre in Selma, Alabama at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. Of course, after Donald Trump was elected, Rep. Lewis, like all sane people, was horrified, and questioned his legitimacy. This led Trump to strike out in his usual petty   and in this case, racist   fashion, and the two have been on the outs ever since.

Lewis simply tweeted:Happy Birthday, Madame President @HillaryClinton  John Lewis (@repjohnlewis) October 26, 2017Of course, the Russians helped elect Trump, and Hillary won the popular vote by more than three million people. Further, Trump is clearly unfit for the office he is currently squatting in, and he is destroying our democracy as we speak. The Electors should have refused to certify his election, and the Electoral College should have functioned as the Founders intended. Further, the American public elected Hillary Clinton, a quirk that allowed a few counties in a few states to flip the electoral votes   along with the Russians   elected Trump. He is illegitimate.

5907,French foreign minister says accepting refugees 'is a duty',"Consideration for the plight of refugees is a duty, and fear of terrorism is not a legitimate reason to refuse them sanctuary, the French foreign minister said on Sunday. Jean-Marc Ayrault’s statement came after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order to restrict people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States [nL1N1FI0JO]. “Accepting refugees is a duty of solidarity,” Ayrault said in a tweet. “Terrorism knows no nationality. Discrimination is no response.” In his most sweeping decision since taking office a week ago, Trump, a Republican, put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily barred travelers from Syria and six other countries. On Saturday, French President Francois Hollande told Trump during a telephone conversation to respect refugees. He also warned the new U.S. leader over his trade policies, saying a protectionist approach would have economic and political consequences [nL5N1FI0PE]. French centrist presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron weighed in with his own view of Trump’s actions on immigration, including his plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico. “I stand with the people fleeing war and persecution.

6706,"New oversight for Voice of America, Radio Free Europe raises concerns","A defense policy bill that President Barack Obama is expected to sign into law this month will give President-elect Donald Trump greater influence over U.S. foreign broadcasting entities. The National Defense Authorization Act passed by Congress last week includes a provision abolishing the Broadcasting Board of Governors, an independent body that oversees government-backed media outlets such as the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, and replaces it with a chief executive nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The election victory of Republican businessman Trump, who has had a stormy relationship with some media outlets he accuses of being biased against him, has raised concerns among some officials about whether the media outlets can maintain their editorial independence under a Trump-appointed CEO.It is not clear, however, if the change is intended to give the president greater influence over news, information and fact-checking that U.S. government-supported broadcasters send to Russia, Cuba, China and other authoritarian states, or whether it is simply an effort to make those efforts more effective. There has been support from both Republicans and Democrats for reorganizing the broadcasting operation to reduce bureaucracy and increase efficiency.  A senior U.S. official familiar with the broadcasting agencies said he was not aware of the Trump transition team making contact with the Board of Broadcasting governors and associated agencies. “We have no (concrete) indication that anything bad’s going to happen,” the official continued.   Congressional aides familiar with the issue said they thought such concerns were overblown, noting that the chief executive must be confirmed by the Senate and that the organization’s basic structure would remain in place, minus the nine-member board. They said the reorganization plan was developed with input from members of both parties in Congress, as well as Democratic officials from the Obama White House. However, some officials in the State Department and the U.S. intelligence community have said they are worried that Trump is not wary enough of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who considers Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s efforts “to promote democratic values” an attempt to undermine his government. The board of governors would first be transitioned into an “International Broadcasting Advisory Board” to advise the new CEO, but that also would be phased out.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2016 ",1

He would send me press clippings about me that he would just sign  Donald Trump.  And he called from time to time to compliment a segment. I didn t know why he was doing that. And then when he announced that he was running for president, it became more clear. But I can t be wooed. I was never going to love him, and I was never going to hate him. Indeed, Kelly has refused to take shit from Trump. During a debate in August, Kelly took Trump on and didn t make things easy for him. Offended, Trump lashed out at Kelly, claiming she was bleeding out of her  whatever. Even after Kelly went on vacation, Trump continued the vicious assaults with the help of his rapid conservative supporters.And now Trump has responded to Kelly s remarks in Vanity Fair by attacking her once again, this time targeting her for her looks and claiming that nobody wants to woo her.

17297,NSA ARCHITECT: NSA SNOOPING EXPIRES BUT FEDS WILL CONTINUE SURVEILLANCE OF AMERICANS’ PHONE RECORDS,"This NSA whistleblower has some very interesting things to say about what will happen now that the right to snoop has expired:The AP had this to say about what s happening now with the NSA:Eight days after blocking it, Senate Republicans have agreed to begin debate on a House bill that would overhaul the National Security Agency s handling of American calling records while preserving other domestic surveillance provisions.But that remarkable turnabout didn t happen soon enough to prevent the laws governing the programs from expiring at midnight Sunday as Republican Sen. Rand Paul, a presidential contender, stood in the way of extending the program, angering his GOP colleagues and frustrating intelligence and law enforcement officials.Now, the question is whether the Senate will pass a bill the House can live with. If so, the surveillance programs will resume, with some significant changes in how the phone records are handled. If not, they will remain dormant.The Senate vote on the measure known as the USA Freedom Act can come no earlier than 1 a.m., Tuesday. Senate Republican aides said they expected some amendments, but no major revisions to the bill. Having gone past the brink, the Senate must now embrace the necessity of acting responsibly,  said Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, in a statement after Sunday s Senate vote.The high-stakes drama played out as Congress debated the most significant changes prompted by the disclosures of Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who revealed the phone records collection and other main surveillance programs. With no deal reached in time, the NSA stopped collecting American phone records at 3:59 p.m. EST Sunday, officials said.Other authorities that expired allowed the FBI to collect business records in terrorism and espionage investigations, and to more easily eavesdrop on a suspect who is discarding cell phones to avoid surveillance.",Government News,"Jun 1, 2015",1
1125,Mike Pence Indicates That He’ll Soon Be In The Russian Hot Seat,"There has been a lot of social media speculation over what will happen if and when Donald Trump is impeached or he is forced to resign. The Constitution, obviously, says that Mike Pence will be made President. Pence, it s assumed, will be a slightly better alternative. While he s anti-LGBT and anti-woman enough to be the inspiration for the Handmaid s Tale, he appears to be just bland enough to be called sane.Not so fast. He might be sane, but if his latest move is any indication, he could be going down with Trump and the rest of the people who are in bed with Russia. He has hired his own lawyer for the apparent inevitability of appearing under oath.The vice president s office said Thursday that Pence has retained Richard Cullen, a Richmond-based lawyer and chairman of McGuireWoods who previously served as a U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia.Pence s decision comes less than a month after Trump hired his own private attorney, Marc E. Kasowitz, to help navigate the investigations related to the Russia probe, and a day after The Washington Post reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is widening his investigation to examine whether the president attempted to obstruct justice.Source: Washington PostOf course, the act of hiring a lawyer in no way means Pence is guilty. What we do know, though, is that Pence knew from at least March that Trump s fired National Security Advisor, General Michael Flynn, was lobbying for a Turkish firm. Yes, there is evidence that policy changed because of Flynn s Turkish ties. Flynn had supposedly left that out when Pence was heading Trump s transition team.The White House, though, sat on that information for 18 days before firing Flynn.Again, hiring a lawyer does not mean guilt, but only three Vice Presidents have done so. Richard Nixon s VP, Spiro Agnew, hired one when he was under investigation for extortion, tax fraud, bribery and conspiracy. He ended up resigning, even before Watergate.Al Gore also hired counsel over questions about illegal fundraising. Dick Cheney hired counsel several times.The significant thing to note, though, is that none of the VPs hired counsel because their bosses were in trouble. They hired counsel because they were under fire. We can t be positive, but it s safe to assume that Pence will soon be testifying, and not just for his opinions.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"June 15, 2017",1
7022,Trump vows to end U.S.-Cuba 'deal' unless Havana makes better one,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday he would end the United States’ “deal” with Cuba unless a better one was made, reflecting his campaign pledge to reverse President Barack Obama’s moves to open relations with the Cold War adversary. “If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal,” Trump said in a Twitter post.  Some Cubans are worried Trump will shut down the U.S.-Cuban trade and travel ties that have begun to emerge in the past two years since Obama’s historic decision to end decades of Cold War hostility and open an embassy in Havana. U.S. airlines launched the first regular flights to Havana in more than five decades on Monday. Trump’s tweeted as Cubans commemorated Fidel Castro, the guerrilla leader who led a revolution in 1959 and ruled the Caribbean island for half a century. Castro died on Friday. During Trump’s campaign for the White House he had said he thought restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba was fine but that Obama should have cut a better deal. Newsweek reported that one of his companies had attempted to do business in the Communist-ruled island. Later in the campaign, he toughened his rhetoric, seeking to reassure Cuban-American voters in Florida that he opposed Castro and his brother, Raul, to whom he turned over power in 2008. On Saturday, Trump said in a statement that his administration would “do all it can” once he takes office on Jan. 20 to boost freedom and prosperity for Cubans after Castro’s death. Cuba always has fiercely resisted what it sees as U.S. involvement in its politics. The government has stayed mostly quiet on Trump, waiting to see whether he converts his rhetoric into policy change. The makeup of Trump’s transition team has suggested he could with the inclusion of Mauricio Claver-Carone, a leading advocate for maintaining a tough economic embargo, and Robert Blau, a hard-line anti-communist who was openly hostile toward the Castro government while posted as a diplomat in Havana during the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. Many Cubans are defiant, however, saying their main problem was the U.S. economic embargo. “We have lived for 50 years with the blockade so we are going to continue living the same way with or without Trump,” Teresa Almentero, 52, a cigar roller, said after paying tribute to Castro in Revolution Square. “He doesn’t scare me, nor does he scare any Cuban.”",politicsNews,"November 28, 2016 ",0
8157,New York attorney general opens probe of Trump Foundation,"New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Tuesday he had opened an inquiry into the Donald J. Trump Foundation to ensure the Republican presidential nominee’s charity was complying with state laws governing nonprofits. Schneiderman, a supporter of Trump’s Democratic rival in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton, sued the real estate mogul and his now defunct Trump University for fraud in 2013, seeking $40 million in restitution plus penalties and other costs. In a CNN interview on Tuesday, Schneiderman said his office had now brought Trump’s charitable foundation under scrutiny. “My interest in this issue really is in my capacity as regulator of nonprofits in New York state. And we have been concerned that the Trump Foundation may have engaged in some impropriety from that point of view,” the elected Democratic official said. He added: “We have been looking into the Trump Foundation to make sure it’s complying with the laws that govern charities in New York.” He did not elaborate on what wrongdoing Trump’s nonprofit might have committed. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung dismissed Schneiderman’s assertions as entirely motivated by presidential politics, calling the attorney general a “partisan hack who has turned a blind eye to the Clinton Foundation for years.” Cheung called Schneiderman’s comments “nothing more than another left-wing hit job designed to distract” attention from Clinton’s recent missteps on the campaign trail. Trump has accused Clinton of being corrupted by donors to the Clinton Foundation global charity founded by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, while she was U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Clinton has dismissed Trump’s allegation as a political smear. There has been no evidence that foreign donors to the foundation obtained favors from the State Department while Clinton headed the agency. Schneiderman made his remarks when asked on CNN about calls from Democrats in Congress for a federal investigation of a $25,000 donation in 2013 from the Trump Foundation to a political committee supporting Florida’s Republican attorney general, Pam Bondi.  Democrats have cited an Associated Press report that Bondi solicited the donation personally, around the time her office was debating whether to join New York state’s investigation into Trump’s real estate training school in Florida. According to the AP, Bondi, who was seeking re-election at the time, broke off the lawsuit deliberations after the check arrived.

Lopez of course, chose to remain in the United States of America.Feb. 2017: Lopez was just caught on tape making racist comments about black people during one of his comedy stints (see video below).When a woman in the audience objected, Lopez went off on an unbelievable, vile rant against her ***WARNING***Strong language*** There are only two rules in the Latino family. Don t marry somebody black, and don t park in front of our house,  Lopez said during his set, which prompted a woman in the audience to put up her middle finger.In a clip of the incident obtained by TMZ, Lopez is seen responding to the woman s gesture by calling her a  bitch  and telling her,  Sit your f**king ass down or get the f**k out. Sit your f**king ass down,  Lopez repeated three times.  I m talking, bitch. You paid to see a show. Sit your ass down. You can t take a joke, you re in the wrong motherf**king place. Sit your f**king ass down or get the f**k out of here. You have two choices,  he continued.  Shut the f**k up or get the f**k out. I ll tell you what. I ll make the choice for you. Get the f**k out of here. I ll make the choice for you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Perhaps George Lopez and Kathy Griffen can find one of those jobs  Americans won t do  when nobody will hire the formerly funny comedians",left-news,"Jul 10, 2017",1

Here s a FOX news reporter who s standing right in front of Obama s buddy and anarchist Bill Ayers! Can you believe this?President Obama s old revolutionary pal, Bill Ayers, was front and center in the middle of a protest staged outside the Chicago Board of Trade/CME Group blocking entrances to the building and demanding a transaction tax on trades made through the exchange.Ayers can be seen in this Fox Business live coverage emerging from the center of the of the crowd blocking the entrance. He remains center frame for almost a minute.

3145,Fast Food CEO CONFIRMS That Minimum Wage Hikes Are GOOD For Business (AUDIO),"A California fast-food CEO has seen the light, and now supports minimum wage increases after seeing for himself that they are good for business.Wetzel s Pretzels  CEO, Bill Phelps, says he and his investors were concerned that minimum wage hikes passed by California lawmakers in 2014, and again in 2016, would negatively affect his business.Apparently, Republican fear mongering over the minimum wage got to him like it gets to many other business owners who actually believe Republicans are telling the truth.For years, Republicans have opposed raising the minimum wage because they claim doing so hurts businesses. They say it will force businesses to raise prices or lay off workers, but that s just simply not the case.In reality, the exact opposite happened. As it turns out, the minimum wage hike created a boom in business because workers had more money in their pockets to spend on things like pretzels. I was shocked,  Phelps told KQED during an interview about how the law has impacted business owners.  I was stunned by the business. In fact, Wetzel s Pretzels saw their profits increase significantly after each minimum wage increase, which now stands at $10.50 an hour in California. And the positive effect is being witnessed by franchise managers like Mike Jacobs. My overall sales were something like 15 percent ahead after the first minimum wage bump, and now they re about 12 percent ahead this year,  Jacobs said.  It isn t because I m such a great manager or smart guy, but the buying public has more money in their pocket. Here s the interview via KQED.But Donald Trump, his Labor Secretary pick Andrew Puzder, and the Republican-controlled Congress threaten all of that success.Trump has repeatedly flip-flopped when it comes to the minimum wage. He has called for it to be eliminated at the federal level, which would let Republicans drastically lower wages in states they control. He has said that he supports raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour, which would nearly match California. But Trump s choice of fast-food CEO Andrew Puzder as Labor Secretary makes it clear that he opposes minimum wage hikes. Trump and Puzder both wrongly believe that raising wages for American workers makes us unable to compete with foreign businesses.But that s a load of bullshit that corporate vultures like Trump spew as an excuse to manufacture their products in China and Mexico instead of paying American workers a fair wage to manufacture the products in the United States.The fact is that raising the minimum wage helps more people than it harms, but Puzder opposes the minimum wage and will be in a position to viciously attack it along with overtime pay rules and rules that require breaks for workers.So while business is booming in California because lawmakers there understand that paying workers more increases the amount of money people will pump back into the economy, Trump and Puzder will be working with Republicans to sabotage the economy by killing the minimum wage laws that made us an economic powerhouse in the first place.Featured image via Twitter",News,"January 5, 2017",0
12999,Thai court jails man for 27 years over Bangkok hospital bomb,"A Thai court sentenced a 62-year-old man to 27 years in prison on Wednesday for planting a bomb at a Bangkok hospital that wounded 21 people. The explosion hit the Phramongkutklao Hospital in the Thai capital, Bangkok, in May on the third anniversary of a 2014 military coup. The hospital is popular with soldiers and their families and retired military officers.  Police arrested Watana Pumret, a retired government employee, after the blast and said he had confessed to the bombing because he despises the military.  From the evidence we believe the accused committed the offence ... the accused confessed to it,  a judge said. Courts in Thailand often do not identify the names of judges, with the exception of some high-profile legal cases. Watana was seen crying after the verdict. He hugged his wife and refused to answer reporters  questions, according to a Reuters reporter at the court. Reuters was unable to contact Watana s lawyer after the verdict. Thailand s military launched a coup in May 2014 after months of street protests that took a toll on Southeast Asia s second-biggest economy. The military promised to unite the politically divided country and restore stability but it has been accused by critics of not wanting to relinquish power. The military government has promised to hold a general election in November 2018 to return Thailand to democracy but senior government figures have said more time was needed to complete laws related to the vote. The government has also cited security concerns as a reason for not lifting a ban on politics that has been in place since 2014, despite increasing pressure from groups of all political stripes to lift the ban.",worldnews,"December 6, 2017 ",1
14628,Ukraine investigators fear corruption cases could get buried,"Ukrainian investigators fear corruption probes could get buried because the national anti-corruption bureau will soon be flooded by thousands of old cases and recently passed legislation could further hobble their work. Their comments spotlight Kiev s patchy record on fighting corruption, which has delayed billions in aid from international donors who have supported Ukraine since the 2014 Maidan protests brought pro-Western forces to power. They come after the NABU anti-corruption bureau launched an investigation this week into an allied crime-fighting agency over extortion allegations.  From Monday, 3,500 cases that were registered before December 2015 will be transferred from the prosecutor s office to NABU, which include for example investigations that may pertain to former Donald Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort. NABU began life in late 2015 and was given an exemption on investigating cases that opened before its creation, which expires on Monday. NABU wants the exemption extended, saying its 200-strong team of detectives cannot cope with the extra work.  In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, NABU spokeswoman Svitlana Olifira said there was a risk that  all current investigations by (NABU) detectives may be blocked . Serhii Horbatiuk, head of special investigations at the general prosecutor s office, said the old cases would be sent to NABU to ensure no-one looks at them. His investigations include two cases related to Manafort s work in Ukraine.   They will simply lie around and not be looked at,  he said in an interview at his office.  My opinion is that this is done deliberately to ensure that crimes linked to former senior officials are either simply not investigated, or obstacles are created that prevent it (the investigation).   The restructuring (of law enforcement) is being used to ensure investigations don t take place,  he added. Neither NABU nor Horbatiuk accused anyone by name of trying to block investigations.  NABU appealed to President Petro Poroshenko to veto legislation passed in October which it believes will also harm investigations.  The law, according to NABU, will put too strict limits on the time allowed for an investigation before it can be dismissed, while also making it more cumbersome for police to obtain permission from courts to open probes.  We urge the president to examine this bill thoroughly and to refrain from signing the current version,  Olifira said, saying the bill could  bring about the collapse of Ukraine s whole law enforcement system.

21922,How Trump is Accelerating the Decline of US Global Influence,"It should also be said that the current US Administration is merely finishing the job which started under three consecutive two-term presidents; Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama   something to bear in mind as Trump ends his first year in office.This new year, let us not forget who re-ignited the Middle East crisis, with the consecutive sackings of Libya and Syria The ""Moderate Rebel"" terrorists in Syria certainly miss you Barack, you were so generous to all of them.  Patrick Henningsen (@21WIRE) December 29, 2017While  Make America Great Again  might be the political campaign de jour at home, these next four years are likely to coincide with an overall decline in US influence in the world.Mehr News reports During the past decades after World WarII and disintegration of the former Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the world has been dominated by the US in terms of politics, military and economy. But the rising of new world powers at the end of the 20th century and beginning of 21st century has challenged the US global domination. Washington s challenges with the new multipolar world order in recent years has resulted in the decline of US influence in the world, which is expected to be accelerated  withTrump s term in White House.Recognizing Al-Quds (Jerusalem) as Israeli regime s capital by Trump created lots of negative reaction and resulted in a resolution by the UN General Assembly despite the US threats   is a clear example of declining US global influence.Decline of US domination over world trade and financial regimesAfter the end of World WarII until 1960, the US held 40 percent of the world economy but after the rise of new economic powers like China, Japan and EU, in 2013 the US just held 25 percent of the world economy. Considering the recent decisions made by Trump to withdraw from TPP and NAFTA and tensions with EU, more decline is expected in near future.The Dollar dominated global financial, trade and banking regimes until the beginning of 21th century. The first blow to the dollar global stand was inflicted in 1999 when euro appeared as official currency of the EU. In recent years rise of Chinese renminbi has inflicted more blows to the dollar global stand, so that in 2015 only 50 to 60 percent of  world trades and transactions were done in dollar, according to EU central bank.During the past years, US sanctions against some countries like Russia, Iran and White House pressure on other countries to avoid transaction with these sanctioned countries, has resulted in some agreements between states to do their business in their own national currencies instead of dollar like the agreements between Iran, Russia, Turkey and China. Continuation of such agreements and trend will definitely lead to further decline of dollar global stand in future.Decline of the US strategic importance in terms of politics and militaryTrump s serious pressure on NATO   the most important strategic achievement of the US till now   with member states to pay more for the costs of the alliance, has inflicted serious damages to the solidarity of the member states and has created many doubts   so that some US old European allies are seriously after formation of a European Army.US inability to solve South Korea s missile and nuclear program issues despite Trump s rhetoric and bluffs, US inability to materialize its regional policy and plans in the Middle East to change the map of the region to the benefit of its own strategic interest and Israel s due to close cooperation of Iran, Russia, Turkey, Iraq and Syria   all these US failures and its wrong policies which have even forced some of its old regional allies like Turkey to recalibrate its relation and cooperation with White House in the region   shows the US limitations and incapability resulting in increasing decline of Washington s influence.Also the US inability to settle the issues in east of Ukraine and Crimea as its European allies expected has been a serious blow to its strategic stand among the Washington s European allies, and even worse nowadays as some of the Europeans consider US measures in east Europe as a blackmailing to gain the energy market of the EuropeDuring the last one year in office, Trump s moves to withdraw from Paris Climate Change accord, TPP, his wrong approach toward the nuclear deal with Iran (JCPOA), his insatiable immigration policy which has resulted in significant reduction in the number of foreign students in US for the first time, and finally his partial recognition of Al-Quds as Israeli regime s capital   all have inflicted serious blows to global credibility and influence of the country which cannot be at least mended in short-term.READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"December 29, 2017",0

12249,Argentina Congress suspends pension reform vote due to protests,"Argentina s lower house on Thursday suspended a vote on President Mauricio Macri s pension reform plan, after the debate became a shouting match and protesters and police clashed violently outside Congress. The bill, which passed the Senate last month, is crucial for Macri s efforts to cut the fiscal deficit but has drawn criticism from opposition politicians and labor unions, who say it will hurt retirees and welfare recipients. Before Thursday s scheduled vote, the country s top union called a general strike for the following day. Demonstrators threw stones at metal barriers set up outside parliament, and security forces responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.  The incident showed strong obstacles remain for Macri s pro-business agenda, which includes tax and labor reforms. While his  Let s Change  coalition swept October s legislative midterm vote, he lacks a majority in either chamber.  We will not back down,  opposition lawmaker Mirta Tundis told local television.  It is outrageous that year after year, those who have less are affected most.  The pension reform would change the formula used to calculate benefits. Payments would adjust every quarter based on inflation, rather than the current system of twice-yearly adjustments linked to wage rises and tax revenue. Economists say the current formula means benefits go up in line with past inflation. Left unchanged, that could harm Macri s efforts to cut the fiscal deficit. Under the new formula, benefits would increase by 5 percentage points above inflation, according to Cabinet Chief Marcos Pena. The plan would take effect at a time of lower inflation expectations, hence slowing the pace of pension benefit increases.  This formula guarantees the sustainability of the system and that retirees will not lose to inflation,  Macri-allied  lawmaker Luciano Laspina told reporters. Macri is aiming to cut the fiscal deficit to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product next year from 4.2 percent this year, and to reduce inflation to 8-12 percent from above 20 percent this year.

21558,FAMILY THREATENED AT GUNPOINT FOR DISPLAYING CONFEDERATE FLAG ON PRIVATE PROPERTY…Police Let Suspect Go [Video],"Nothing says tolerance like putting a loaded gun to a strangers head because you disagree with the flag they re holding A family was threatened at gunpoint for waving the Confederate flag on their own private property in another illustration of how controversy surrounding the flag is only driving more animosity.The incident occurred on Monday night in Moseley, Virginia while the family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family and started yelling. He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn t worth anything now,  Mark Wilson told CBS 6.  He got out of the car and took three steps towards me and the gun was maybe six inches off my head. Wilson said he was concerned that the gunman would shoot his children. 46-year-old James Baker was later arrested by police for brandishing a weapon. Baker dubiously claimed that the family had threatened his life. This is a busy highway and he is in a vehicle going 70 miles per hour, how are we threatening him by walking across?  said Wilson, who called for Baker to be sent to jail. The police went and investigated it and they let him go, he admitted everything and they just let him go,  added Wilson.Baker is in court on September 3 facing a class one misdemeanor charge.Wilson asserted that his decision to fly the flag is founded on a desire to express pride in his southern heritage and has nothing to do with racism. I m not gonna be scared away from people that are acting ignorant and trying to act violent when it s not a violent thing. This shouldn t be a race thing, it should be a heritage thing,  Wilson told NBC 12.The nature of the confrontation clearly illustrates how the gunman had a political gripe with the family displaying the Confederate flag, which has become a target for irate leftists in the aftermath of the Charleston shooting.On Monday we reported on the new viral Twitter craze called #NoFlaggingChallenge which Black Lives Matter supporters are using to encourage Americans to violate people s private property rights and steal Confederate flags being displayed on privately owned homes and vehicles.Given that the flags are predominantly displayed in southern states where private ownership of firearms is common, many on social media are warning that the stunt could end up with people being shot dead.Via: Infowars",left-news,"Jul 16, 2015",0
15020,Radical Catholic Bishops Push Warming Scam: ‘Put An End To The Fossil Fuel Era’,"Our vision of the world ? Where are the Catholics who re against this scam? The Catholic church has been hijacked by leftists who re following the one world global agenda in the name of social justice: Fossil fuel is the cheapest form of energy man has these days, and these people have the audacity to talk about  the cry of the poor  while advocating for things that will make it far more difficult for them to exist and survive?????  The only thing that makes life unfair is the delusion that it should be fair.    Steve Maraboli Does this political agenda mean the church is now giving up its tax exempt status? You can t have it both ways. Please speak up against this! The ten-point plan advanced by the bishops calls for the adoption of  a fair, transformational and legally binding global agreement based on our vision of the world.  In the lead-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris next month, a group of cardinals, patriarchs and bishops have called for a radical, legally binding international climate agreement that mandates, among other things, complete global decarbonization by 2050 and  an end to the fossil fuel era.  The nine prelates claim to represent  the Catholic Church from the five continents  and will address participants in the COP 21 in Paris taking place from November 30 to December 11, 2015. Signers include Archbishop Joseph Kurtz, the president of the U.S. Bishops Conference, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, president of the union of European Bishops Conferences (COMECE) and Cardinal Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop of Bombay. Drawing inspiration from Pope Francis  encyclical letter on the environment Laudato S , the bishops express the  widely-held hope that a just and legally binding climate agreement will emerge from the negotiations of the COP 21 in Paris,  and to this end, advance  a ten-point policy proposal.  In their appeal, the bishops reference the  dramatic acceleration of climatic change,  which, they say,  is the result of unrestrained human activity.  They also claim that this ecological phenomenon is primarily due to  excessive reliance on fossil fuels.   The Pope and Catholic Bishops from five continents,  the declaration states,  appeal for a drastic reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide and other toxic gases.  Human-induced climate change, the bishops continue, is having a  dramatic impact  on  sea levels, extreme weather events, deteriorating ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity.

2244,Oklahoma Supreme Court rules fee on cigarettes unconstitutional,"Oklahoma’s Supreme Court declared a fee on cigarettes unconstitutional on Thursday, citing faulty lawmaking practices, prompting the state’s governor to suggest calling back the legislature to find a solution to replace the lost revenue. In a statement following the court’s decision, Republican Governor Mary Fallin said invalidating the fee would cause a $215 million budget shortfall. Most of the revenue created by the passage in May of the “cessation” fee - $1.50 per pack of cigarettes - was earmarked for health and human services agencies. “These agencies and the people they serve cannot sustain the kind of cuts that will occur if we do not find a solution,” Fallin said. “My belief is we will have to come into special session to address this issue.” The court called the fee a “revenue raising measure” that was passed in violation of the state’s legislative process that requires that such measures cannot be passed in the last five days of a session. The measure also did not garner either a required supermajority vote in favor, or a vote by the people to pass. Lawmakers were attempting to fill an $878 million shortfall.  A special session would cost the state an additional $30,000 per day, according to a statement released Thursday by the House Democratic Caucus. Petitioners, which included both tobacco and wholesale distribution companies, argued that the fee was a revenue-raising measure. Attorneys representing the state said the principle purpose of the fee was not to raise revenue, saying that it primarily aimed at reducing smoking rates, and therefore did not have to follow the constitutional process. Oklahoma has a balanced budget requirement. Its fiscal-year 2018 budget totaled about $6.8 billion, according to Michael McNutt, a spokesman for Fallin. The yield on Oklahoma 10-year general obligation bonds traded 20 basis points over the benchmark Thomson Reuters Municipal Market Data AAA yield scale on Wednesday, according to the data available. The yield was little changed from the end of May, when the state’s legislative session ended.",politicsNews,"August 10, 2017 ",0
5273,Peru's president tells Trump he favors bridges to walls,"The first Latin American leader to visit U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House said on Friday that he told Trump he prefers bridges to walls and favors the free movement of people across borders. However, Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski declined to comment specifically on Trump’s proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking in a press conference following the meeting. “I don’t want to get into the wall,” Kuczynski, a former Wall Street investment banker said in a video distributed by his office. “We’re interested in the free movement of people ... I emphasized that to President Trump and we prefer bridges to walls.” Kuczynski has previously likened Trump’s wall proposal to the Berlin Wall and once joked that he would cut off ties with the United States if Trump were elected president. Kuczynski later congratulated Trump on his surprise electoral victory and described their talk on Friday as “cordial and constructive.” Trump called Peru, a country of 30 million in South America, “a fantastic neighbor” and said it was an honor to have Kuczynski in the White House, according to video showing the two posing for pictures after the meeting. Kuczynski said the two leaders only briefly discussed Peru’s fugitive former President Alejandro Toledo, whom Peru had asked Trump to deport from the United States under a provision of migratory law that allows for deportations to preserve diplomatic ties. “This is a matter of the judiciary that was not discussed for more than a few seconds,” Kuczynski said of Toledo. Up until a week ago, Kuczynski’s centrist government had seen deporting Toledo as a better alternative to a potentially lengthy process of Peru’s judiciary seeking his arrest and eventual extradition. Toledo is wanted in connection with a far-reaching graft probe and has denied prosecutors’ allegations that he took $20 million in bribes from Brazilian builder Odebrecht SA. In discussing migration, Kuczynski said he emphasized to Trump that only 70 Peruvians out of 1 million living in the United States are in jail, 200,000 of whom are there illegally.     “Peru has not exported criminals to the United States,” Kuczynski said. “They’re nurses, they’re doctors, they’re all sorts of people.”",politicsNews,"February 24, 2017 ",0
7425,Putin says will try to repair ties with U.S.A. under Trump,"Russia is ready to do its part to fully restore ties with Washington following the election of businessman Donald Trump as the next U.S. President, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday. Trump stunned the world by defeating heavily favored rival Hillary Clinton in Tuesday’s presidential election, ending eight years of Democratic rule and sending the United States on a new, uncertain path. Among those uncertainties will be the Trump administration’s future relations with Russia. Ties between Washington and Moscow have become increasingly strained over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and allegations of Russian cyber attacks featured in the U.S. election campaign. “We heard the campaign statements of the future U.S. presidential candidate about the restoration of relations between Russia and the United States,” Putin said on Wednesday at a ceremony to receive credentials from new foreign ambassadors. “It is not an easy path, but we are ready to do our part and do everything to return Russian and American relations to a stable path of development,” he added. “This would be good for both the Russian and American people and have a positive impact on the climate of world affairs.” Trump is widely viewed as friendly to the Kremlin and Putin has said previously his future counterpart is a talented and colorful character. The Kremlin said earlier on Wednesday Russia hoped coordination with the United States over the war in Syria, where the two countries back opposing sides, would improve under the new U.S. president.",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",0

If the Sweden Democrats  attempt to unseat Lofven fails, they will call for a no-confidence motion in Hultqvist. The center-right Alliance bloc has also said it will table a motion of no-confidence in Hultqvist. If Hultqvist is forced to resign, he would be the third minister to fall victim to the IT scandal. No-confidence motions are rare in Swedish politics. Since 1980, only seven have taken place and none one has succeeded.",worldnews,"September 13, 2017 ",0
4060,U.S. Congress may seek one-week funding extension to avert shutdown,"The U.S. Congress inched toward a deal to fund the government through September but was preparing to possibly extend a midnight Friday deadline in order to wrap up negotiations and avoid an imminent government shutdown. The one-week extension would give leading Republicans and Democrats “a little breathing room” to finish negotiations and present their plan for spending around $1 trillion through the rest of the fiscal year to rank-and-file lawmakers, according to a House of Representatives source familiar with the talks. Negotiators were racing against the clock to clear away remaining disputes in the massive spending bill. The arduous talks have produced at least two major victories for Democrats so far, even though they are the minority party in Congress. President Donald Trump gave in to Democratic demands that the spending bill not include money to start building the wall he wants to erect on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump has said the “big, beautiful, powerful” wall is needed to block illegal immigrants and drugs from coming into the country. Mexico has adamantly rejected Trump’s assertion that it would pay for the wall. Democrats have also gotten the administration to agree to continue funding, at least for now, for a major component of the Affordable Care Act, even though Trump campaigned on a vow to end the program, commonly known as Obamacare. Administration officials had threatened in recent days to pull the plug on subsidies for low-income people enrolled in the 2010 healthcare law, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. “While we agreed to go ahead and make the ... payments for now, we haven’t made a final decision about future commitments,” a White House official said. Anthem Inc, one of the largest insurers on the Obamacare exchanges, said on Wednesday that without the government payments, premiums would increase 20 percent next year and that it might have to withdraw from some regions and states. Both concessions robbed Trump from claiming some major legislative successes he had hoped to achieve in his first 100 days in office, which will be marked on Saturday. If Congress cannot agree to either a short stopgap funding bill or a longer-term one by midnight Friday, federal agencies will run out of money and likely have to abruptly lay off hundreds of thousands of federal government workers until an appropriations bill is enacted. Many policymakers are nervous about a repeat of 2013, when the government was shuttered for 17 days. It was unclear whether Republicans might prevail on their demand for a significant increase in defense spending without similar increases to other domestic programs. Trump has proposed a $30 billion spending boost for the Pentagon for the rest of this fiscal year. “Our major concerns in these negotiations have been about funding for the wall and uncertainty about ... payments crucial to the stability of the marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act. We’ve now made progress on both of these fronts,” House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. She added that other disagreements must be ironed out. “We’re getting really close,” House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, told reporters earlier on Wednesday, adding that negotiators were “getting down to the last, final” areas of disagreement. Trump’s push for a border wall, a signature campaign proposal, is seen by most Democrats and many Republicans as an ineffective way of securing U.S. borders. The Trump administration likely will seek money for the wall in legislation funding the government for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, but lawmakers are likely to balk again. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from the coal-mining state of Kentucky, threw his weight behind a plan Democrats were insisting on to make a healthcare program for coal miners permanent. It was unclear if Ryan would go along. Even though Trump’s fellow Republicans control both chambers of Congress, they only have 52 seats in the Senate. To amass the 60 votes needed there to pass a spending bill, Republicans will have to win the support of at least some Democratic lawmakers. Democrats have been seeking immediate assistance for a funding gap in Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program, the federal health insurance program for the poor, saying it is in such bad shape that 1 million people are set to lose healthcare. Also unclear is what “riders” that set new policy might be tucked into the legislation. Past riders have touched on areas such as banning the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring corporations to disclose political donations. Democrats said they were worried Republicans could try to attach language limiting family-planning funds or undo Wall Street reforms enacted after the 2007-09 financial crisis.",politicsNews,"April 26, 2017 ",1
5844,TX Teacher Infuriates Mother With Note Implying Her Daughter May Die In Next Orlando-Like Attack,"A Texas mother recently woke up to possibly one of the most infuriating things a parent can see   a nasty, bigoted message on Facebook that was warning her about her lesbian daughter. Cassie Watson s daughter, Ali Chaney, was sent home from school last month for wearing a t-shirt that read,  Some people are gay. Get over it,  in rainbow letters. That s how this teacher knows Ali is gay.The message in question said:The teacher, who appears to be a woman named Janice Williams, tried to weasel out of taking responsibility for this when she was asked about the offensive message: My FB account was hacked yesterday and I was not responsible for the message sent to the lady causing her to believe that her child would be harmed. It took several attempts to delete the account after notifying FB that my account had been hacked. I have lived my life protecting the rights of others and being an advocate for ALL children. I m saddened that a hacker can cause such negativity and division among so many people. Please give my sincerest apology to this woman and her child. Thank you.' Oh, bull cookies. Isn t that always the fallback excuse when you write something horrible like that to someone?  My account was hacked.  However, like any sane person would when confronted with something that sounds like so many hollow excuses, Watson called it  garbage. The school district says the t-shirt was  disruptive,  because several students had complained. Like telling LGBTQ students they have to kowtow to the whims of homophobes or be singled out and punished isn t disruptive. Nevertheless, they stood by that decision, issuing a statement that said: Our purpose at CCISD is to educate children, first and foremost. According to CCISD s dress code in the student handbook and code of conduct, clothing that is disruptive to the learning environment based on reactions by other students is prohibited. The student was offered a school shirt to wear and declined. There s more, though. KCEN-TV reached out to the district and discovered that this teacher resigned way back on June 3, well before this message was sent, and for a reason completely unrelated to this situation. One might think that Williams felt free to spread her homophobia because she wouldn t face any consequences for doing so.This is not something that anybody should ever send out, because it just perpetuates the cultural problem that played a huge role in the Orlando massacre. Anybody who would send a message like that has their hands covered in the blood of the LGBTQ people who have died in hate crimes.Featured image via screen capture from KCEN-TV news report and Facebook",News,"June 17, 2016",0

20827,JetBlue offers $99 flights out of Florida ahead of Hurricane Irma,"JetBlue Airways Corp is offering $99 direct flights from every Florida city where it operates, the airline said on Wednesday, as people hurry to leave before powerful Hurricane Irma hits the state. A price cap through Sept. 10 is also in place for all of JetBlue s Florida connecting flights, a maximum fare of $159 up to the last available seat, the company said.  We want those trying to leave ahead of the hurricane to focus on their safe evacuation rather than worry about the cost of flights,  JetBlue spokesman Doug McGraw said. Flights in the eastern Caribbean through Sept. 7 and in the western Caribbean through Sept. 8 are also under a fare ceiling. Florida remained under a state of emergency as Irma, packing winds of up to 185 miles per hour (295 km per hour), tracked across the northern Caribbean on a path expected to hit  landfall in the United States over the weekend. Airlines have been criticized for raising prices in the wake of deadly episodes such as a 2015 Amtrak derailment, but U.S. officials said last year they found no evidence of wrongdoing in that instance.  Irma s arrival marks the second time in as many weeks U.S. airline operations will be disrupted by a powerful storm.

10278,Protests planned for Trump speech at pro-Israel conference,"Some rabbis and Jewish students are planning protests against Donald Trump’s speech on Monday at a conference of the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC over what they say are his belittling comments about Muslims and other groups. About 18,000 people are expected to attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s three-day annual conference in Washington. It is not clear how many will either boycott or walk out of the Republican presidential front-runner’s address.  “He has taken every opportunity to vilify women, Muslims, Mexicans, immigrants and the disabled,” said Jeffrey Salkin, a rabbi in Hollywood, Florida, who asked rabbis across the country to join him in a boycott. He said 40 had agreed and signed a protest letter he hoped to distribute at the conference. Another group of rabbis and students called Come Together Against Hate is planning to walk out of the room after Trump takes the stage. Jesse Olitzky, one of its organizers, said he did not know how many people would participate. The group’s Facebook page had 300 members. Some of the students received an email earlier this week from AIPAC warning that if they disrupted the speech, they would have their conference access revoked. An AIPAC official said on Thursday the message “went out in error and was not authorized.” “I know nothing about that,” Trump said in a Reuters interview on Thursday when asked if he had heard about the planned protests and whether he intended to respond. When he announced his candidacy last summer, Trump said some people crossing the U.S. border from Mexico were criminals and rapists, and promised to build a wall along the border. In December, he called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, on national security grounds. Last week, he told CNN: “Islam hates us.” The Anti-Defamation League and an organization of Reform rabbis condemned his comments.  AIPAC, which is non-partisan, routinely hosts presidential hopefuls at its conference. Trump’s remaining Republican rivals, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich, will address the group as well.  “The job of AIPAC is not to decide whose policies we like or look into the souls of people,” said Seth Siegel, an AIPAC veteran who said he was not speaking on behalf of the organization. “It’s the organization’s job to try to educate elected officials about how to deepen the U.S.-Israel relationship for the benefit of both parties,” he said. “Having Trump speak at the policy conference is unambiguously part of that mission.”",politicsNews,"March 17, 2016 ",0

6450,Trevor Noah And The Daily Show Correspondents Collapse With The Giggles Over This GOP Nightmare (VIDEO),"The Republican Party is busy with a pitted civil war between those who are willing to jump on Trump s crazy train, and those who realize the party has to be saved from the ultra-conservative extremism which handed a trust fund tycoon the party leadership. But as the Daily Show attempted to report events this week, things were so crazy, the team couldn t keep a straight face.Noah begins by outlining the GOP dilemma. Now the voting is over, and Republicans have chosen a mutant from a carrot juicing accident. As the party wakes up to that devastating reality, the GOP is splitting along the Trump fault line. Noah describes their plight with typical relish: You ve got the people who support Trump. You ve got the people who aren t ready to support Trump. And the most interesting people are a group who spent the whole race throwing sh*t at Trump. And now, they re picking it back up, spreading it on a sandwich, and taking a big bite. The host then shows clips of come-lately Trump supporters railing against the candidate in the most personal and vivid terms earlier in the race. Bobby Jindal calls Trump  weak  and a  narcissist,  and claims he would not back him in the event of his becoming nominee. But the real gold comes from Rick Perry, who refers to Trump as a  cancer  on the party and America, then chooses to back him. But even more insane, is that Perry now even wishes to become Trump s running mate! This left Noah almost tearful with laughter: So wait  he says.  You want to be running mates with cancer? That s what you re saying? I mean, I guess it has a pretty sturgeon history of winning .but still! Noah goes on to compare the GOP split like that of commuters waiting for a subway train. The doors open, and there s some crazy guy screaming. For some they think, well, it s my train, I m just going to have to  get on board the crazy train.  While others simply refuse, and to hell with the consequences.But when Noah reaches out to his correspondents for their take on the situation, no one can keep a straight face. Jordan Klepper collapses laughing, saying: They were all such assholes for so long and they completely did this to themselves! Noah turns to Hasan Minhaj in hopes of getting more sensible commentary, but he also falls apart when comparing the GOP to  a dog that chewed its own balls off.

7594,Sanders Campaign Fights Back After Ohio Bans Youth From Primaries,"Twenty-two states, including the District of Columbia, allow 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections as long as they turn 18 by the time the general election is held in November. The rule allows many youth to begin participating in the democratic process of voting for the very first time, but Ohio s Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted reversed the rule in Ohio, revoking the rights for 17-year-olds to vote in Ohio s primaries on March 15th. For both Republicans and Democrats, Ohio will be a key state and every vote will matter. For the Bernie Sanders campaign, the reversal is a blow, as the campaign s strongest demographic is young voters, where they have received over 80 percent support in many states from voters ages 18-29. It is an outrage that the secretary of state in Ohio is going out of his way to keep young people   significantly African-American young people, Latino young people   from participating,  said Senator Sanders in a released on March 8th. Sanders  campaign cited US Census data which shows 17-year-old voters are more likely to be African-Americans and Latinos.Ohio s Secretary of State, Jon Husted, argued over the language of Ohio s rule in December, claiming 17-year-olds can still vote, just not to elect a candidate. This isn t the first time Ohio Republicans have tried to deter voter turnout. In 2015, Republican Ohio State Representatives sponsored a bill to demand a poll tax in order to vote, despite poll taxes being unconstitutional. The tax was tucked into a Voter ID bill, which was pushed for under the false assumption Voter ID laws prevent fraud, although voter fraud is virtually non-existent in Ohio. If a voter does not have a photo ID, they will have to pay $8.50 for a voter ID card.

He yelled  You re all Goebbels In case you don t know:GOEBBELS WAS THE NAZI PROPAGANDA MINISTER:German Nazi Party member Joseph Goebbels became Adolf Hitler s propaganda minister in 1933, which gave him power over all German radio, press, cinema, and theater.In 1925 Goebbels met the party leader Adolf Hitler. In 1926 he was made Gauleiter, or party leader, for the region of Berlin, and in 1927 he founded and became editor of the official National Socialist periodical Der Angriff (The Attack). He was elected to the Reichstag, the German parliament, in 1928. By exploiting mob emotions and by employing all modern methods of propaganda Goebbels helped Hitler into power. His work as a propagandist materially aided Hitler s rise to power in 1933. When Hitler seized power in 1933, Goebbels was appointed Reichsminister for propaganda and national enlightenment. From then until his death, Goebbels used all media of education and communications to further Nazi propagandistic aims, instilling in the Germans the concept of their leader as a veritable god and of their destiny as the rulers of the world. In 1938 he became a member of the Hitler cabinet council. Late in World War II, in 1944, Hitler placed him in charge of total mobilization. As Reichsminister for Propaganda and National Enlightenment, Goebbels was given complete control over radio, press, cinema, and theater; later he also regimented all German culture. Goebbels placed his undeniable intelligence and his brilliant insight into mass psychology entirely at the service of his party. His most virulent propaganda was against the Jews. As a hypnotic orator he was second only to Hitler, and in his staging of mass meetings and parades he was unsurpassed. Utterly cynical, he seems to have believed only in the self-justification of power. He remained loyal to Hitler until the end. On May 1, 1945, as Soviet troops were storming Berlin, Goebbels committed suicide.Via: whale",politics,"Jun 16, 2017",1

15843,Kurds offer joint border deployment as Iraq threatens more military operations,"Iraq s Kurdish region said on Thursday it had offered a joint Kurdish-Iraqi deployment at a strategic crossing into Turkey with the participation of U.S.-led international forces as part of a compromise aimed at ending a stand-off with Baghdad. The offer was disclosed hours after the Iraqi armed forces threatened to resume military operations against the Kurds, accusing them of delaying the handover of control of borders and taking advantage of negotiations to bolster their defenses. The central government in Baghdad has cracked down hard on the Kurds since the government of the Kurdish autonomous region staged an independence referendum on Sept. 25 that Baghdad considers illegal. Central government forces swiftly seized swathes of Kurdish-held territory last month and have demanded control of all border checkpoints, including the Turkish frontier which has been controlled by the Kurds since the Saddam Hussein era. Over the past week, the Kurds have tried to defuse the crisis with negotiations. The Kurdish defense department said the offer for joint control of the frontier was part of a  deconfliction  proposal made to Baghdad on Oct. 31. Other proposals included a ceasefire on all fronts, continued cooperation in the fight against Islamic State and joint deployments in so-called disputed territories claimed by both the Kurds and the Iraqi central government. The KRG  continues to welcome a permanent ceasefire on all fronts, deconfliction and the start of a political dialogue  with Baghdad, the Kurdish statement said. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi suspended military operations against the Kurds on Friday. The sides have since held talks which Baghdad says cover only technical issues, with political questions off the table unless the Kurds discard the referendum. Iran and Turkey back Abadi s tough line, fearing a drive for independence could spread to their own Kurdish populations.  The Kurdish statement said the offer of a joint deployment at the strategic Fish-Khabur crossing was meant  as a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi Constitution . Fish-Khabur is strategically vital for the landlocked Kurds as the point where oil from northern Iraq crosses into Turkey. Iraq wants the Kurdistan region to stop exporting its own oil and hand over sales to the Iraqi state-oil marketer SOMO, the company s director said on Thursday. Iraq is talking to Turkey to let SOMO sell Kurdish crude that arrives by pipeline, acting SOMO director general Alaa al-Yasiri told reporters. The Iraqi Joint Operations Command accused the Kurds on Wednesday of using the talks  buy time  to strengthen positions.  We will not allow it; the federal forces are mandated to secure (the disputed) areas and borders,  it said in a statement. The command of the Kurdish security forces, known as Peshmerga, accused Iraqi troops of massing weapons and threatening force to resolve  domestic political differences . The office of the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq said more than 183,000 civilians had been displaced by the conflict, including 79,000 from Kirkuk city which Baghdad captured on the first day of its offensive last month.  A humanitarian official involved in the relief efforts said more than three quarters of the displaced are Kurds. Iraqi troops set up positions on Tuesday at the Turkish border for the first time, between Turkish and Kurdish checkpoints at Habur, the Turkish name for the road border crossing located 10 km from Fish-Khabur in Iraq. The Turkish frontier with Iraqi Kurdistan is a critical security issue for Turkey, which says Kurdish insurgents fighting against the Turkish state shelter across it. Turkish security forces killed 17 Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants near the border, the Turkish armed forces said on Thursday, after eight members of Turkey s security forces were killed in clashes. The Kurdish militants were intercepted crossing the border into Turkey, the Turkish military said.",worldnews,"November 2, 2017 ",0

11057,NANCY PELOSI’S Latest Over-The-Top Claim: Trump will “take food out of the mouths of babies and seniors”,"Nancy Pelosi s latest claim is over the top:In a conference call with reporters, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, criticized Trump s late push for some funding for the wall now, which she said would be wrong if it was budgeted for at the expense of government programs like those that help young people, the elderly and the environment. He did not promise that he would take food out of the mouths of babies and seniors and education, clean air, clean water, scientific research off the table in a significant way in order for him to pay for his immoral, ineffective, unwise proposal of a wall,  Pelosi said.But she said she was open to some technology and other improvements at the border so long as they were not related in any way to the planning, prepping or building of the wall itself. Read more: The HillHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was on Meet the Press and let out another gibberish laden response to a question. Does anyone out there understand what she meant by her comments about the wall. How does it mean Trump is weak if he wants a wall? Twisted reasoning is all that comes from Pelosi these days especially when in 2006 most prominent Democrats voted to build a barrier at the border. Immoral and unwise ? How is it immoral and unwise to want to protect your people? You have to understand this part of the country. There s a community going through it. WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO THE 2006 BORDER WALL FENCE?Remember the promise of a fence on our southern border? Yes, it was the plan but the $1.2 billion dollar plan was never executed as proposed. You can thank our Liar in Chief and a popular Republican for that WE RECENTLY POSTED THIS VIDEO OF AN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL SAYING BUILDING A BORDER FENCE  ISN T POSSIBLE  EVEN THOUGH $1.2 BILLION WAS GIVEN IN 2006 FOR A FENCE:  In his speech in El Paso on immigration reform on May 10, 2011, Obama declared that the fence along the border with Mexico is  now basically complete.  Like much of what comes out of the Obama administration, that was a lie. What was supposed to be built was a double layered fence with barbed-wire on top, and room for a security vehicle to patrol between the layers. Except for 36 of the seven-hundred mile fence, what was built looks like the picture above or the one below.But that doesn t stop your liar in chief. He claims. We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement,  Obama said.  All the stuff they asked for, we ve done. But even though we ve answered these concerns, I ve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time. Maybe he s right the goal posts were moved, but to make the job easier.The Secure Fence Act was introduced on Sept. 13, 2006 by Rep Peter King (R-NY) and passed Congress on a bi-partisan basis. In the House of Representatives, the Fence Act passed 283 -138 on September 14, 2006. On September 29, 2006, the Fence Act passed in the Senate 80 -19. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 s goal was to help secure America s borders to decrease illegal entry, drug trafficking, and security threats by building 700 miles (1,100 km) of physical barriers along the Mexico-United States border. Additionally, the law authorized more vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting as well as authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to increase the use of advanced technology such as cameras, satellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce infrastructure at the border. So far less than 40 miles of a real fence have been built   most of it during the Bush Administration.Of the almost 700 miles of fencing, DHS reports there are currently 36.3 miles of double-layered fencing, as the bill required, the kind with enough gap that you can drive a vehicle between the layers. But the majority of the fencing erected has been made from vehicle barriers with single-layer pedestrian fencing, the kind of barriers that are designed to stop vehicles rather than people. The design specifications vary, depending on geography and climate characteristics, but according to the Customs and Border Patrol website, those include  post on rail  steel set in concrete; steel picket-style fence set in concrete; vehicle bollards similar to those found around federal buildings;  Normandy; vehicle fence consisting of steel beams; and concrete jersey walls with steel mesh. The first blow against the promised fence was made by Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican Senator from Texas, at the urging of DHS she proposed an amendment to give the Department discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read,  Nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.  Hutchison s amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007 despite the fact that Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., had a cow he argued the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill, he was right. Hutchison s intentions may have been honorable, but she didn t foresee Barack Obama being the next president.When Janet Napolitano became Obama s first DHS she took advantage of Ms. Hutchison s 2007 amendment, instead of building a fence which look something like the below, she built a fence that was mostly a combination of the two pictures above.When She was still Governor of Arizona Janet Napolitano said,  You show me a 50-foot wall, and I ll show you a 51-foot ladder at the border. And she may be right The fence will never STOP all illegal crossings. The purpose of the fence is two-fold, slowing the intruders and making them visible to members of the border patrol. The rest of the work is done by human beings.Very little of the Israeli separation barrier erected to keep out terrorists is a wall, most of the 400 miles of the barrier which has received so much international scorn is a two layered fence like section of their barrier below. The fence has served its purpose, in 2002, the year before construction started, 457 Israelis were murdered; in 2009, 8 Israelis were killed.The reason it has been effective is not simply the fence itself but how the fence is guarded and patrolled. And that s what will make our fence along the Mexican border work.Here s the bottom line. Back in 2006 the people of the U.S. were promised a border fence. Since then thanks to Kay Bailey Hutchison and Barack Obama 95% of the fence wasn t built. The arguments against the fence are bogus especially if you look at Israel s history. It s time for America to demand that its leaders build the fence they promised. No one can honestly say it wont work, after all it hasn t been tried. Via: The Lid",politics,"Apr 25, 2017",0
18647,Spanish police occupy Catalan tech hub before banned vote,"Spanish police have occupied the Catalan government s communications hub on the eve of a banned independence referendum which Madrid is attempting to thwart, the regional authority said on Saturday. Tens of thousands of Catalans are expected to vote in a ballot that will have no legal status as it has been blocked by Spain s Constitutional Court and Madrid has sent thousands of police to the northeastern region to stop it taking place. But Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont told Reuters on Friday that the referendum would go ahead regardless.  Everything is prepared at the more than 2,000 voting points so they have ballot boxes and voting slips, and have everything people need to express their opinion,  Puigdemont said. On Saturday a Catalan government spokesman said at least four police officers had entered the center in Barcelona which controls the regional government s telecommunications and IT and were expected to stay there for two days. This followed an order by Catalonia s High Court on Friday for police to prevent electronic voting taking place. The court also instructed Google to delete an application it said was being used to spread information on the vote. Police and Spain s interior ministry did not confirm the action. The head of the Catalan regional police has ordered officers to evacuate and close polling stations by 6 a.m. on Sunday, before the voting is due to open at 9 a.m. At a closing rally for the independence campaign in Barcelona on Friday, people formed the slogan  Referendum is democracy  in large white letters on a stage in front of a cheering crowd, many draped in the red-and-yellow Catalan flag. Other Catalans camped out in polling stations in order to defy court orders to close them.",worldnews,"September 30, 2017 ",1
8198,Glenn Beck Anchor In Race Attack On Beyoncé For Super Bowl Show (VIDEO),"An anchor for Glenn Beck s TV network, The Blaze, is the latest right-wing media figure to attack Beyonc  for her Super Bowl halftime performance.Tomi Lahren, who hosts the show Tomi, used her program to berate Beyonc s work. Lahren, 23, argues that,  Your husband was a drug dealer. For fourteen years, he sold crack cocaine. Talk about protecting black neighborhoods? Start at home. https://youtu.be/cwVnDRx8EikThat is a reference to Beyonc s husband, rapper and rap mogul Jay Z. The strange bit is that Lahren is referring to behavior Jay Z engaged in when he was a teenager. He is now 46 years old, and has had a multi-decade career topping music charts, producing some of the biggest names in music, working in fashion and other industries. He is worth an estimated $520 million, and has sold over 100 million records and received 21 Grammy Awards.Lahren has inadvertently made a point about the racial injustice and prejudice Beyonc  was alluding to in her performance and in the song  Formation,  when she reduces Jay Z s life to his teenage mistakes   which he has been very open about in his work   and ignores his business success and philanthropy (he was part of a $1 million donation to rebuild New Orleans after Katrina, for instance).She joins other conservatives like former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani in attacking Beyonc s performance for having the nerve to bring up Hurricane Katrina, black pride, and police shootings of black civilians.The mindset being promoted by Lahren in this attack definitely fits in with former Fox News host Glenn Beck, who welcomed her to The Blaze  family  in October of last year after several of her right-wing video rants went viral.Beck, who is still heard on the radio after a cascade of dropped sponsors pushed Fox to cancel his show. Has a history of racially charged remarks. He said President Obama had a  deep-seated hatred of white people,  claimed progressives were pushing for a  race war,  promoted a book written by an anti-semite, and repeatedly claimed Obama was trying to enslave people.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 10, 2016",1
4210,Trump FRANTICALLY Spins Illuminati-Like Global Conspiracy Theory To Explain His Death Spiral,"Since disgusting revelations came to light that show the Republicans  horse crap-covered, diseased nutsack of a nominee is actually a sexual predator, Trump has been frantically trying to cover his ass in every way imaginable. There is no line he will not cross, no level to which he will not sink, in order to turn the whole thing around in a pathetic attempt to come out smelling like roses. That includes pushing ever-wilder conspiracy theories about how the nefarious Hillary Clinton is behind all of this.Yes, Trump wants people to believe that this is all a worldwide smear campaign specifically intended to derail his candidacy. His asinine cease-and-desist letter to The New York Times revealed that (along with the true intent of the lawsuit threat), and so do the growing, nutty conspiracy theories he was touting in West Palm Beach today: The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media: the press. Let s be clear on one thing, the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They re a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or any other financial entity with a total political agenda and the agenda is not for you, it s for themselves.Their agenda is to elect crooked Hillary Clinton at any costs, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy. For them, it s a war. And for them, nothing at all is out of bounds. This is a struggle for the survival of our nation. Believe me. And this will be our last chance to save it. Oh, it s a war all right, but it s a war against the evil that pervades Trump and his loyal, minion-y followers. Nobody s destroyed Trump s life but Trump himself. When it comes to the women he s assaulted   he s out to destroy their lives, and the lives of members of the press, for daring to report the truth about him. He is so not a victim.Trump s followers are dead certain that this election will be stolen from them, and Trump is playing that like a master violinist. For Trump, it s simple: The election is stolen if he loses. The election is fair if he wins. End of story.His minionish cult of followers see it the exact same way.But wait! It gets better. He also drew connections between his assault victims coming forward, Wikileaks, and Hillary: These claims are all fabricated, they are pure fiction, and they are outright lies It s not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment and all together at the same time as Wikileaks releases documents exposing the massive international corruption of the Clinton machine. Coincidence or not, nothing changes the fact that he s a sexual predator who has no business being anywhere near a position of such power and responsibility as the presidency.As he continued to speak, his descent into madness became clearer: We ve seen this [corruption] first hand in the Wikileaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends, and her donors. The funny thing is that those emails reveal nothing of the sort. Time pointed out that a lot of things he said there are  invented.  As The Atlantic put it, they show a political candidate being political. Is that good? Not necessarily. However, they don t reveal anything nearly as horrific as what s come out about Trump recently.It s time for the cowardly GOP to actually come forward as a unified party and do something about this man. He s beyond help at this point.Featured image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images",News,"October 13, 2016",1
6420,Russia hacked Republican state campaigns but not Trump's: FBI head,"Russia hacked into Republican state political campaigns and old email domains of the Republican National Committee but there is no evidence it successfully penetrated President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign, FBI Director James Comey said on Tuesday. Comey also told lawmakers Russia did not release information obtained from the state campaigns or the old RNC email domains, comments that may buttress the U.S. intelligence view that Moscow tried to help Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies on Friday released an assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a covert effort to help Republican Trump’s electoral chances by discrediting Clinton.      The report, which omitted classified details, was the U.S. government’s starkest public description of what it says was a Russian effort to manipulate the American electoral process by leaking hacked emails from Democrats. Russia has denied interfering in the election but President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian suspected spies from the United States and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies last month in response to the allegations. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told a news conference on Tuesday those penalties were “a start and not the end” of U.S. retaliation for the hacks, and senior officials have suggested covert action may be taken. Comey told lawmakers the Federal Bureau of Investigation  “did not develop any evidence that the Trump campaign, or the current RNC, was successfully hacked.” He did not say whether Russia had tried to hack Trump’s campaign.        Trump has disputed the accusations of Russian cyber attacks during the election, but his incoming chief of staff said on Sunday that the New York businessman accepts the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusions that Russia was responsible, and that further action may be taken against Moscow. Comey declined to comment on whether or not the FBI might be investigating links between Russia and associates of Trump, who frequently called during the campaign for improved relations between Washington and Moscow.  The FBI director was pressed by Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, to publicly provide a declassified answer to the question before Jan. 20, the day Trump will be inaugurated, but Comey suggested he would unable to do so.             Comey appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee along with the director of national intelligence, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency and the chief of the National Security Agency at a time of controversy in Washington about the 2016 election. Testifying before Congress for the first time since Trump beat Clinton on Nov. 8, Comey has been criticized by Democrats for statements about a separate investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state. The controversy over Russia’s alleged role in attempting to influence the election has roiled Washington, with Democratic lawmakers calling for an independent commission to investigate the matter and Republicans worried that the affair might call into question the legitimacy of Trump’s victory. Comey said there was evidence Russia hacked Republican state-level political campaigns and “old” email domains that the RNC was no longer using. In contrast, Friday’s report assessed that Russian military intelligence used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and the Guccifer 2.0 “persona” to release emails that it had acquired from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats as part of the effort to help Trump and harm Clinton.     The DNC denied “multiple requests” made by the FBI to examine its hacked servers, Comey said. He added that his agents relied on a forensic analysis conducted by the cyber security firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC to help clean up the hack when it was detected last spring.    Senior U.S. Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Tuesday seeking to impose a wide range of sanctions on Russia over its cyber activities and actions in Syria and Ukraine.",politicsNews,"January 10, 2017 ",1

2253,Trump's 'fire and fury' North Korea remark surprised aides: officials,"President Donald Trump’s vow to respond with “fire and fury” if North Korea persisted in threatening the United States caught his foreign policy and military aides by surprise, two administration officials with direct knowledge of how the issue unfolded said on Wednesday. “President Trump’s comment was unplanned and spontaneous,” said a senior administration official who deals with the Korea issue and who requested anonymity. The comment was “all Trump,” said another administration official who, like the first, requested anonymity. Both officials said Trump, known for his off-the-cuff remarks, had not run that language by his senior aides beforehand. At an event on Tuesday on the topic of Americans over-using opioids, Trump said: “North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” U.S. officials and analysts cautioned against engaging in rhetorical shouting matches with Pyongyang, which in turn said it was considering a strategy to fire missiles at the U.S.-held Pacific island of Guam, where there is a military air base. The White House pushed back on Wednesday, saying General John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff and others on the National Security Council team were “well aware of the tone of the statement of the president prior to delivery.” “The words were his own. The tone and strength of the message were discussed beforehand,” spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in New Jersey, where Trump is at one of his golf courses on a working vacation. Sanders said that Kelly and others “were clear the president was going to respond to North Korea’s threats following the sanctions with a strong message in no uncertain terms.” After two intercontinental ballistic missile tests by Pyongyang last month, the U.N. Security Council imposed new sanctions against North Korea, that could slash its annual export revenue by a third. Pyongyang warned it was ready to teach the United States a “severe lesson.” The senior administration official who deals with the Korea issue told Reuters:  “There had not been any discussions about escalating the rhetoric in response to North Korean leader Kim (Jong Un)’s statements or about the possible effects of doing that,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Nevertheless, it is important for the North Koreans to understand that this country’s strategic patience is exhausted and that our resolve to defend our allies, whatever is required to do that, is not.” Privately two other U.S. officials, who also spoke on  condition of anonymity, said the president’s threat of “fire and fury” was not helpful and threatened to evoke an undesirable response from the North Korean leader. It also risked alienating U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, as well as adversaries China and Russia, all of whom Washington wants to help pressure Kim to abandon his pursuit of a robust nuclear arsenal capable of striking the continental United States. On Wednesday, Trump appeared to temper his comments by expressing hope that the U.S. nuclear arsenal would never need to be used. Senior administration officials found different ways to explain Trump’s “fire and fury” remark. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to play down the tough talk, saying Trump was just trying to send a strong message in language North Korea’s leader would understand because he “doesn’t seem to understand diplomatic language.” Speaking to reporters before landing in Guam on a previously planned trip on Wednesday, he said there was no imminent threat from North Korea and Americans should “sleep well at night.” By contrast, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis used some of his strongest language yet on North Korea, warning Pyongyang it must stop any action that would “lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people.” He said North Korea’s actions would continue to be “grossly overmatched by ours and would lose any arms race or conflict it initiates”. The State Department said the White House, State Department and Department of Defense were all “speaking with one voice.” State Department Press Secretary Heather Nauert said Trump and Tillerson had spoken for an hour after the president made his “fire and fury” comment. “We are all singing from the same hymn book,” Nauert said.",politicsNews,"August 9, 2017 ",1

So it looks like Coulter and the rest of Trump s hardcore supporters have lost a little trust in their candidate, which is hysterical since Coulter s new book is titled In Trump We Trust.To mock Trump s supporters, RINO Pundit used the Hitler biopic film Downfall and changed all of the subtitles to show the Nazi leader furiously throwing a temper tantrum over Trump s new immigration flap.

149,"Jeff Sessions: Oh, You Mean THAT Russian Contact. I Remember Now!","The Attorney General of the United States lied under oath, but that seems to be the status quo in the Trump administration. During Sessions  confirmation hearing in January, he told Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) that he was  not aware  of evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government during the campaign. But today, his selective memory issues seem to be clearing up. However, the only reason Sessions is admitting there was contact with the Trump administration is because of court documents that were unsealed Monday revealing that Donald Trump s former campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, floated the idea of setting up a meeting between the former reality show star and Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2016. Papadopoulos claimed he had  connections  that could help arrange the meeting between Trump and Putin.On top of that, an Instagram picture on Trump s account shows Sessions attended the meeting in which Papadopoulos made the suggestion.So, it s kind of a big deal, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is all up in this administration s business over the Russia scandal. A source familiar with the matter told NBC that Sessions rejected the meeting.And apparently, Sessions doesn t remember if he remembers that. Or something.Source clarifies: Unclear whether Sessions recalls nixing the Papadopoulos proposal for Trump Putin meeting   though he did do so.  Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) November 2, 2017Sen. Franken isn t too happy about the  alarming pattern  in which Sessions  apparently failed to tell the truth, under oath, about the Trump team s contacts with agents of Russia a hostile foreign power that interfered in the 2016 election. Once again, developments in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election have brought to light evidence that you failed to tell the truth about your interactions with Russian operatives during the campaign, as well as your awareness of Russian contacts by other members of the Trump campaign team,  Franken wrote in a statement. We must get to the bottom of what happened so that we can prevent it from happening again,  Franken wrote.  I am deeply troubled that this newest revelation strongly suggests that the Senate and the American public cannot trust your word. In June, Sessions said that he had  no knowledge  of any conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign about  any type of interference with any campaign  by Russians.Who knew that a racist elf would lie?

6706,"New oversight for Voice of America, Radio Free Europe raises concerns","A defense policy bill that President Barack Obama is expected to sign into law this month will give President-elect Donald Trump greater influence over U.S. foreign broadcasting entities. The National Defense Authorization Act passed by Congress last week includes a provision abolishing the Broadcasting Board of Governors, an independent body that oversees government-backed media outlets such as the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, and replaces it with a chief executive nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The election victory of Republican businessman Trump, who has had a stormy relationship with some media outlets he accuses of being biased against him, has raised concerns among some officials about whether the media outlets can maintain their editorial independence under a Trump-appointed CEO.It is not clear, however, if the change is intended to give the president greater influence over news, information and fact-checking that U.S. government-supported broadcasters send to Russia, Cuba, China and other authoritarian states, or whether it is simply an effort to make those efforts more effective. There has been support from both Republicans and Democrats for reorganizing the broadcasting operation to reduce bureaucracy and increase efficiency.  A senior U.S. official familiar with the broadcasting agencies said he was not aware of the Trump transition team making contact with the Board of Broadcasting governors and associated agencies. “We have no (concrete) indication that anything bad’s going to happen,” the official continued.   Congressional aides familiar with the issue said they thought such concerns were overblown, noting that the chief executive must be confirmed by the Senate and that the organization’s basic structure would remain in place, minus the nine-member board. They said the reorganization plan was developed with input from members of both parties in Congress, as well as Democratic officials from the Obama White House. However, some officials in the State Department and the U.S. intelligence community have said they are worried that Trump is not wary enough of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who considers Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s efforts “to promote democratic values” an attempt to undermine his government. The board of governors would first be transitioned into an “International Broadcasting Advisory Board” to advise the new CEO, but that also would be phased out.",politicsNews,"December 14, 2016 ",0
866,WATCH: Anderson Cooper Throws MAJOR Shade At White House Aide Over ‘Fake News’,"An interview with CNN anchor Anderson Cooper and Sebastian Gorka Wednesday night went off the rails when the White House deputy assistant started lecturing the host on  fake news.  It s remarkable really because Gorka is  fake.  Even his PhD is fake and yet, he used to insist that everyone call him  Doctor.  Still yet, the fake doctor couldn t help himself and launched into a rant against  fake news. It s laughable. Your chryon talked about a  crisis,  Gorka told Cooper in response to a suggestion that the White House was in turmoil.  I actually work in the West Wing, I work in the White House, it is absolutely nothing of the kind. The president is a steam locomotive that can t be stopped. It s just fake news. I m sad to see CNN fall to this,  Gorka said.  I know you want salacious and sensational coverage for your ratings so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money, but that s not media, that s not reportage. It s just fake news. Okay, I m just going to ignore the insults because I don t think it really gets us anywhere,  Cooper shot back.Cooper pressed Gorka over a tweet which Trump posted on Twitter saying the media often makes up its sources, despite the fact that Trump Jr. released the email chain which confirms The New York Times  reporting.Remember, when you hear the words ""sources say"" from the Fake Media, often times those sources are made up and do not exist.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017 I m giving you an opportunity right now to correct what the president said this morning. Because what he s alleging is that the reporting is fake and in fact, his son s own email chain shows that it s accurate. Do you deny that?  Cooper asked. No, I deny the fact that there is anything here that is untoward. Again this is an obsessive nine-month campaign,  Gorka said.An exhausted Gorka eventually said,  I thought we were going to talk about real issues, like what we re doing with our allies in France, defeating ISIS. I am going to ask you but you re not being honest, you re not being upfront,  Cooper responded. How many minutes are we in?  Gorka said. Are you a TV producer now?  Cooper fired back.  You re concerned about how many minutes we ve been talking? Do you have somewhere else to go? If you gotta go, you gotta go. You re falling into the fake news trap again,  said Gorka.  And it s sad, Anderson. You re shaking shiny objects to try to divert people, but I don t think viewers are really that easily diverted,  Cooper said. Do you know why the president s description of a witch hunt is accurate,  Gorka asked.  Because there never were witches. And there never was any collusion. It s bogus   Anderson, you re like a broken record. No, because I m not getting any answers from you,  replied Cooper. I m answering it. Every time,  said Gorka. No, you re responding,  said Cooper.  You re not actually answering because you re not actually being up front. Let s let the viewers judge,  Gorka said, who then mocked CNN s ratings. You used that line on Monday, and you know, it was sort of mildly amusing,  Cooper said.  But I think it s funny that you have enough time in the White House, which is apparently you re so busy, you re able to sit around [and] read Nielsen numbers. No, I had really good prep from my team, because the White House press team is superb,  Gorka said.  I don t deal with this stuff because I do have a day job.

21922,How Trump is Accelerating the Decline of US Global Influence,"It should also be said that the current US Administration is merely finishing the job which started under three consecutive two-term presidents; Bill Clinton, George W.

Patrick Henningsen (@21WIRE) December 29, 2017While  Make America Great Again  might be the political campaign de jour at home, these next four years are likely to coincide with an overall decline in US influence in the world.Mehr News reports During the past decades after World WarII and disintegration of the former Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the world has been dominated by the US in terms of politics, military and economy. But the rising of new world powers at the end of the 20th century and beginning of 21st century has challenged the US global domination. Washington s challenges with the new multipolar world order in recent years has resulted in the decline of US influence in the world, which is expected to be accelerated  withTrump s term in White House.Recognizing Al-Quds (Jerusalem) as Israeli regime s capital by Trump created lots of negative reaction and resulted in a resolution by the UN General Assembly despite the US threats   is a clear example of declining US global influence.Decline of US domination over world trade and financial regimesAfter the end of World WarII until 1960, the US held 40 percent of the world economy but after the rise of new economic powers like China, Japan and EU, in 2013 the US just held 25 percent of the world economy. Considering the recent decisions made by Trump to withdraw from TPP and NAFTA and tensions with EU, more decline is expected in near future.The Dollar dominated global financial, trade and banking regimes until the beginning of 21th century. The first blow to the dollar global stand was inflicted in 1999 when euro appeared as official currency of the EU. In recent years rise of Chinese renminbi has inflicted more blows to the dollar global stand, so that in 2015 only 50 to 60 percent of  world trades and transactions were done in dollar, according to EU central bank.During the past years, US sanctions against some countries like Russia, Iran and White House pressure on other countries to avoid transaction with these sanctioned countries, has resulted in some agreements between states to do their business in their own national currencies instead of dollar like the agreements between Iran, Russia, Turkey and China. Continuation of such agreements and trend will definitely lead to further decline of dollar global stand in future.Decline of the US strategic importance in terms of politics and militaryTrump s serious pressure on NATO   the most important strategic achievement of the US till now   with member states to pay more for the costs of the alliance, has inflicted serious damages to the solidarity of the member states and has created many doubts   so that some US old European allies are seriously after formation of a European Army.US inability to solve South Korea s missile and nuclear program issues despite Trump s rhetoric and bluffs, US inability to materialize its regional policy and plans in the Middle East to change the map of the region to the benefit of its own strategic interest and Israel s due to close cooperation of Iran, Russia, Turkey, Iraq and Syria   all these US failures and its wrong policies which have even forced some of its old regional allies like Turkey to recalibrate its relation and cooperation with White House in the region   shows the US limitations and incapability resulting in increasing decline of Washington s influence.Also the US inability to settle the issues in east of Ukraine and Crimea as its European allies expected has been a serious blow to its strategic stand among the Washington s European allies, and even worse nowadays as some of the Europeans consider US measures in east Europe as a blackmailing to gain the energy market of the EuropeDuring the last one year in office, Trump s moves to withdraw from Paris Climate Change accord, TPP, his wrong approach toward the nuclear deal with Iran (JCPOA), his insatiable immigration policy which has resulted in significant reduction in the number of foreign students in US for the first time, and finally his partial recognition of Al-Quds as Israeli regime s capital   all have inflicted serious blows to global credibility and influence of the country which cannot be at least mended in short-term.READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"December 29, 2017",1
15377,ROMNEY CRITICIZES TEA PARTY CANDIDATE TED CRUZ ABOUT TOUGH RHETORIC ON IRAN AND CRUZ COMES OUT SWINGING: “You got clobbered [by Obama] because you didn’t have the guts to keep going.”,"A transcript from the Friday, July 31, 2015 Rush Limbaugh show. Rush is truly one of the most brilliant political analysts of our time. He proves it with this commentary on Mitt Romney and Ted Cruz:RUSH: Mitt Romney is out there ripping into Ted Cruz, and I made the observation that I can t recall a presidential candidate   losing presidential candidate   ripping presidential candidates in his own party in the next election cycle. I was trying to think, in the modern era, if there was an example of it. I couldn t think of one. It wasn t so much trying to think of Reagan s 11th commandment as I was thinking more about establishment Republican versus upstart Tea Party conservative.By the way, here s another thing: I ve been doing  In the course of show prep, I ve been doing just a voluminous amount of reading about the divide here between the establishment in Washington, both parties, and the Republican Party, what s happening with Trump and so forth. Now, I knew! I knew that the Democrats had elevated the Tea Party into being something horrible and giant and bad, negative. I had no idea Eh, that s not quite true. I didn t fully appreciate the extent to which the Republican Party has enmity for the Tea Party. The Washington establishment treats the Tea Party  They re genuinely afraid of it. Let me put it this way: They re genuinely afraid of it because of its size and its power, and the amazing thing about that is the Tea Party is not something about which is organized around an individual. I think this is why they fear it. It is genuinely bottom-up.It s an effervescent movement of average, ordinary people fed up with Washington, just totally fed up with government, totally fed up with what government is doing. Peggy Noonan has a piece today, and she says that the Tea Party and others, it s not hatred for government they have, it s contempt for government. But the Tea Party is genuinely feared, and it s genuinely feared because it is thought to be huge, and it s put the whole Republican establishment on defense.So, anyway, Ted Cruz  isn t backing off the tough rhetoric he s used to describe the Iran nuclear deal, despite criticism leveled by  Mitt Romney yesterday. Cruz  fired back at Romney in a Thursday radio interview   So Mitt Romney s tweet today said,  Gosh, this rhetoric is not helpful,  Cruz said.  John Adams famously said,  Facts are stubborn things.  Describing the actual facts is not using rhetoric; it is called speaking the truth.'  Cruz then fired another fact. Part of the reason that Mitt Romney got clobbered by Barack Obama is because we all remember that third debate where Barack Obama turned to Mitt and said,  I said the Benghazi attack was terrorism and no one is more upset by Benghazi than I am!  And Mitt, I guess listening to his own advice, said,  Well gosh, I don t want to use any rhetoric. So OK, never mind. I ll just kind of rearrange the pencil on the podium here,  Cruz said.  And he s right! We do remember that debate.I mean, Romney must have had three, different, slow-pitch curveballs, softballs, just tailor made for grand-slam home runs, and he just didn t even take a swing at them. Remember that? After the first debate, when Romney just cleaned Obama s clock, do you remember that? The Democrats and the media were all asking,  What happened to Obama? Oh my God, does he even want to be reelected?  They were scared to death because Romney just made mincemeat.After that one, it was like it never happened, almost like Romney felt guilty for doing it. Because he went into a defensive mode and did not do anything else that might offend or upset or irritate anybody. And it was clear that the consultants had gotten hold of him. Maybe they didn t have to. Maybe he believed it himself. But the consultants had gotten a hold of him and said,  Look, you can t keep criticizing the president. The independents don t like that! We re never going to win. We have to show we can cooperate. We have to show we can work with the Democrats!  So Romney shut up. But what Cruz s point is very simple (summarized):  What are you beating up on me for? I m not the enemy. I m not the Democrat Party. Why don t you start talking about them this way? They re the ones actually doing a deal that s going to put this country at risk. Why don t you say that?  Effectively what Cruz is saying is,  I m not the problem here, Mitt! And this isn t  rhetoric.  I m simply citing facts. So now people are starting to ask:  Is Cruz following in the Trump mold? Is Trump serving to show the way for other Republicans how to respond?  Well, maybe Trump is, but Cruz doesn t need to be shown. This is standard operating procedure for Cruz. I mean, it was just two weeks ago that he went to the floor of the Senate and accused the majority leader of lying to him face to face. Now he s firing back at Romney. But try this headline. Well, it s not a headline. It s a paragraph subhead. Both Obama and Romney have called Cruz s remarks inappropriate.  What has Cruz done? He s  maintained that [Obama] would become a leading state-sponsor of terror if the agreement it struck with Iran makes it past Congress. He and others have argued that Iran would use a windfall from sanctions relief to finance terror abroad.  He has said on that basis alone this deal ought not get done! And then Romney piped up and said in a tweet (paraphrased):  Gosh, this rhetoric isn t helpful. Gosh, this rhetoric isn t helpful! Cruz fired back:  You re telling me what s not helpful? You got clobbered by Obama for a reason! You got clobbered because you backed off. You got clobbered because you didn t have the guts to keep going.  So this is  I like this, folks. Whatever Trump s responsible for it or not.END TRANSCRIPTVia: RushLimbaugh.com",politics,"Aug 2, 2015",1
2980,Trump says Senate Republicans likely to pass healthcare bill,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday expressed confidence that the Republican-led Senate would ultimately prevail in  passing legislation aimed at repealing and replacing the 2010 healthcare law passed under his predecessor, former Democratic president Barack Obama. “It’s very tough ...

120,Congressman will not seek relection amid misconduct probe,"U.S. Representative Ruben Kihuen announced on Saturday that he will not seek re-election, becoming the latest member of Congress to end his legislative career in the face of sexual harassment allegations.   The first-term Nevada Democrat, who is the subject of an ethics investigation in the House of Representatives, denied the allegations against him but concluded that the charges would distract from “a fair and thorough discussion of the issues” on the campaign trail. “It is in the best interests of my family and my constituents to complete my term in Congress and not seek reelection,” Kihuen, 37, said in a statement issued by his campaign committee. The news website BuzzFeed has reported allegations that Kihuen sexually harassed a staff member of his 2016 political campaign. This week, there were also multiple reports of an anonymous lobbyist’s description of his unwanted advances. Reuters has not independently confirmed the reports.  Kihuen is the latest in a growing roster of male lawmakers in Congress who have been accused of sexual misconduct amid a wave of such allegations against powerful men in entertainment, politics and the media. Lawmakers are working on legislation to update the body’s rules on sexual harassment. On Friday, Democratic Representative Bobby Scott of Virginia was accused of touching a former aide without permission and offering to advance her career in exchange for sex. The aide also said she was wrongfully dismissed from her job. Scott denied the charges. Republican Representative Blake Farenthold also said this week that he would not seek re-election after accounts surfaced that he created a hostile work environment. He denied allegations of sexual harassment but admitted allowing an unprofessional culture in his Capitol Hill office.  Last week, Democratic Representative John Conyers and Republican Representative Trent Franks resigned, while Democratic Senator Al Franken said he would step down in the coming weeks.",politicsNews,"December 16, 2017 ",0
20202,SHOCKER! WHY BERNIE SUPPORTERS At DNC Overwhelmingly Say They’ll Vote TRUMP…[VIDEO],"It s only logical that the people who supported Bernie Sanders, the  anti-establishment  candidate would be more attracted to a successful business man who s never spent a day of his life as a politician. Making the decision to support Donald Trump, who said he would only run if our nation got so bad he couldn t take it any longer, to a woman who s spent her entire life scratching and clawing her way to the top, and harming anyone who got in her way of her ultimate goal seems like a no-brainer. The $21 million Hillary pulled down from speaking engagements on Wall Street over a 2 year period might have something to do with it as well .This week at the Democratic National Convention, much of the focus was not on nominee Hillary Clinton, but on Bernie Sanders and his enthusiastic contingent of young supporters.While some had speculated that Sanders supporters would fall in line after his endorsement of Clinton, it appears that this consolidation has yet to gain any momentum.Bernie supporters, emboldened by the recent DNC email leak, took to the streets in Philadelphia to voice their displeasure with Hillary and the Democrat party as a whole.With chants of  Hell no DNC, we won t vote for Hillary  and  Lock her up,  the protesters made it clear they would not be casting their votes for Hillary Clinton. But who would they be voting for instead?Campus Reform went to the DNC to speak with these protestors about how they planned to vote in November, and the results will be shocking to many. I m throwing this race to Trump!  said one protester I was strong for Bernie, and now I m taking a stand for Trump,  said another.When asked why he would be voting for Donald Trump, one protester noted that, as he spent  time talking to Trump supporters, we agree on a lot of the major issues that we re facing in this country. We re both mad about the same things. Citing the anti-establishment nature of the Sanders and Trump campaigns, one protester pointed out that,  for some people, Bernie is the person they stuck with, but there are some anti-establishment things they want, and they ll go with Trump.

5661,Over 9.2 million sign for Obamacare amid Trump repeal push,"More than 9.2 million U.S. consumers signed up for health insurance using the Healthcare.gov website during the open enrollment period between November and Jan. 31, the U.S. government said on Friday. Enrollment was down from 9.7 million a year ago but the decline was smaller than some had predicted amid President Donald Trump’s push to overturn former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform under which the plans are sold. With several insurers pulling out over rising costs, and Republican congressional efforts to scuttle the Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as Obamacare, the enrollment period was seen as a test of the program’s popularity. HealthCare.gov sells health insurance under the ACA for 39 states. The remaining states run their own exchanges. The total number of plan selections across all states for the entire open enrollment period will be released in March. Average premiums for the second-lowest cost silver plan rose 25 percent compared with the previous year. At the same time the number of insurance providers choosing to participate in the exchanges fell by 28 percent. Of the 9.2 million, about 3 million were new consumers while 6.2 million were returning consumers. The figures include any cancellations that occurred during the period. Trump’s surprise victory in early November as the enrollment period got underway created serious doubts about whether people would sign up for the insurance program. A move by the Trump administration to pull television ads reminding consumers that the enrollment deadline was approaching likely contributed to the dropoff. “This may have cost about 500,000 additional enrollments,” said Ron Pollack, executive director of healthcare consumer advocacy group Families USA, in a statement, calling the move an “attempt to sabotage enrollment.” “And despite all that, millions of consumers still got their insurance through the ACA,” Pollack said. Meanwhile, Republican efforts to repeal the healthcare law have stumbled over an inability so far to come up with a comprehensive replacement plan. Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee this week said changes to the law would be made in “chunks” and would be better labeled a “repair.”",politicsNews,"February 3, 2017 ",0
3805,Chomsky: Electing Trump Gave ‘Total Control’ To The ‘Most Dangerous Organization In World History’,"Renowned scholar Noam Chomsky has been warning of a Trump presidency and his fears have now become a reality. His assessment of the current situation? In an interview with Truthout, Chomsky said electing Trump has given  total control of the government  to Republicans, who he describes as  the most dangerous organization in world history. On November 8, the most powerful country in world history, which will set its stamp on what comes next, had an election,  Chomsky said.  The outcome placed total control of the government   executive, Congress, the Supreme Court   in the hands of the Republican Party, which has become the most dangerous organization in world history. Chomsky s primary concern with Republicans is their staunch refusal to accept climate change as a reality and their determination to destroy the planet as quickly as possible. Apart from the last phrase, all of this is uncontroversial. The last phrase may seem outlandish, even outrageous. But is it? The facts suggest otherwise,  Chomsky explained.  The Party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life. There is no historical precedent for such a stand. Chomsky went on to say that humans are facing the biggest disaster in our history. Republicans, especially Trump, seem hell-bent on doing all they can to ensure our demise. It is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history   whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know   and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster,  Chomsky said.He added that when it comes to Trump,  Similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human survival: the threat of nuclear destruction, which has been looming over our heads for 70 years and is now increasing. Chomsky said that Trump voters were driven by their desperation for  change  and that is what Trump offered, but he noted that the  change  that Trump is likely to bring will be harmful or worse.  He said that they were also driven by bigotry, citing studies which  show that doctrines of white supremacy have had an even more powerful grip on American culture than in South Africa. The political theorist said that this is exactly what he has spent years trying to warn people about. For many years, I have been writing and speaking about the danger of the rise of an honest and charismatic ideologue in the United States, someone who could exploit the fear and anger that has long been boiling in much of the society, and who could direct it away from the actual agents of malaise to vulnerable targets,  Chomsky said.  That could indeed lead to what sociologist Bertram Gross called  friendly fascism  in a perceptive study 35 years ago. But that requires an honest ideologue, a Hitler type, not someone whose only detectable ideology is Me. The dangers, however, have been real for many years, perhaps even more so in the light of the forces that Trump has unleashed. A good deal depends on his appointments and circle of advisers. Early indications are unattractive, to put it mildly,  Chomsky added.You can read Chomsky s full interview with Truthout, here.Featured image via William B.

17470,Soccer star Weah and VP Boakai near Liberia presidential run-off,"Liberian former soccer star George Weah and Vice President Joseph Boakai were comfortably ahead in partial presidential election results announced on Saturday, and look set to contest a run-off next month. Weah and Boakai lead the 20-candidate field to succeed Nobel Peace Prize winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in what would be Liberia s first democratic transfer of power in more than 70 years. Weah received 39.2 percent of roughly 1.2 million ballots cast in nearly three-quarters of polling stations, ahead of Boakai, who had 29.6 percent of the vote, the commission said. Charles Brumskine, a lawyer, was a distant third with 9.7 percent. The final certified results from Tuesday s poll must be announced by Oct. 25, although provisional results from the remaining precincts are expected in the coming days. The commission said that ballots would be re-cast in two polling places in Nimba County due to irregularities, although that measure only concerns a few thousand votes. Weah became the first non-European to win the European player of the year award in 1995, the same year he picked up the African and World player of the year awards.  He finished runner-up to Johnson Sirleaf in a 2005 election that helped draw a line under years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of civilians. He has been a senator for the opposition CDC party since 2014. Boakai, the former head of Liberia s petroleum refinery company and agriculture minister, has served as Liberia s vice president since 2006 and represents the ruling Unity Party.  Brumskine has said the vote was marred by fraud and that he would request a re-run. However, he has yet to produce evidence of cheating and international observers said they saw no major problems.  Johnson Sirleaf s 12 years in office have seen the consolidation of Liberia s post-war peace and the quadrupling in size of the national economy. However, many Liberians complain about poor public services and widespread corruption and say they are eager for a new president. Weah s strong first-round performance drew mixed reactions on the streets of Monrovia, the capital. One woman held a small radio close to her ear as the latest results were read out by the state broadcaster.  We will see a new president now come next year,  she said.  Our son Weah will be the next president.  Standing nearby, a man in his late 50s, Cyrus S. Mulbah, had a different view.  It will be a sad mistake if this country goes in the hands of Weah and his people,  he said  This is not a football field.",worldnews,"October 14, 2017 ",1
9330,JOY BEHAR Still Claims Clinton Won…BUT Wore Bizarre Mourning Item When Hillary Lost [Video],"The View s Joy Behar just let everyone know that she s a sore loser who just can t let go that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election. Even though she refuses to acknowledge Trump as president and says Hillary won, she told The View audience that she wore a black veil when Clinton lost indicating that she was in mourning. So which is it?She represents all of those on the left so well. She s STILL bitter and in denial over the loss. What a waste of time and energy to be part of the  resistance  to President Trump.She gets into it with  co-host Meghan McCain over it:   She did win and I m not going to give that up. The segment started with a  Hot Topics  discussion of Sen. John McCain s (R., Ariz.) interview with Esquire magazine where he trashed Clinton s post-election book. He sat down for an interview with Esquire, and he would like Hillary Clinton to hush. Because he says he felt it was a mistake for her to write a book so soon after she lost and that he learned after his loss the hardest thing to do is just shut up. Now, is he right?,  co-host Whoopi Goldberg asked her fellow hosts. With all due respect to your father and whom I like very much, I think he s wrong,  Behar said toward McCain.  I think a woman s place is in the resistance. The woman won the election. Behar s comment was met with audience applause and cheers. What I think I could get on board with if she wrote it and got it out but maybe waited to release it so it becomes more historical. Because I think the optics of looking at someone that s lost whether you agree with them, and I voted for her, or not it looks bad when you didn t win and you re talking,  co-host Sara Haines said. She did win,  Behar interjected.  She did win and I m not going to give that up. She didn t win,  McCain retorted. She won the popular vote,  co-host Sonny Hostin said.Behar continued to argue with McCain that Clinton won the election. But we don t elect presidents in America with the popular vote,  McCain said. I get that. But the numbers are still there,  Behar replied. Does that make you feel good at night when you re so angry about Trump, does that make you feel better?  McCain quipped. No, it doesn t,  Behar said.Behar then admitted she work a black veil when Trump beat Hillary.McCain recounted the night her father lost to President Barack Obama in 2008, expressing the extent to which she understands the difficulties of losing an election. Because you were up close and personal when your father didn t win the election,  Hostin said. And I ve been there on election nights for other candidates who have wanted it and it s deeply sad. On election night we prayed and my father told me to  buck up, we re the most blessed people in the world.  And then, we didn t complain about it. We as a family recognized President Obama as the phenomenon that he was,  McCain said.  Whether or not you like it, President Trump is a populist phenomenon in a completely different way. And I think if I were you, and I m part of the resistance, I would look forward to new leadership.",politics,"Nov 28, 2017",0

507,U.S. Senate liberals propose new steps for Puerto Rico recovery,"Puerto Rico would get substantial debt relief and other new aid to help it recover from destruction inflicted by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September, under legislation unveiled on Tuesday by leading liberals in the U.S. Senate. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, called for a new “emergency credit facility” of up to $57.2 billion for Puerto Rico and $5 billion for the Virgin Islands, according to a summary of the bill. The bill would also extend the deadline for individuals to apply for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The legislation cannot advance without the support of Republicans, who hold a slim majority in the Senate. Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration have approved some $51 billion in aid to the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and U.S. states hit by hurricanes and wildfires, with a new round expected to be approved in December. The effort has been criticized as lackluster by many Democrats in Congress, with large swaths of Puerto Rico still without power and clean water. Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello is seeking more than $94 billion in disaster recovery aid, including $31.1 billion for housing and $17.8 billion to rebuild and bolster the power grid. The legislation would put Congress on record in support of relieving Puerto Rico’s $72 billion debt. The island has a further $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. Kenneth Mapp, governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, said the island had requested $7.5 billion to cover uninsured hurricane-related damages to the public sector. The hurricanes devastated the island’s healthcare sector, destroying two already struggling hospitals. Mapp also asked for a waiver to use $226 million in unspent Medicaid funding provided under Obamacare. The island was unable to spend the money because the local government could not provide its share of matching funds. The Sanders-Warren plan would also restore the U.S. minimum wage for certain young workers in Puerto Rico, open some federal food and nutrition programs to the two territories and improve benefits under the Medicare and Medicaid health programs.

Opposition hopes for a referendum to recall President Nicolas Maduro were dashed, on grounds of fraud in an initial signature drive. The vote was off. For many in the opposition, that settled a years-old debate about the nature of Venezuela’s socialist government, uniting them in conviction they are now fighting a dictatorship. Their new militancy heightens the risk of unrest as the South American OPEC member of 30 million people grapples with a dangerous economic and political crisis. “Can anyone in the world now really doubt that Venezuela is living in tyranny?” said housewife Mabel Pinate, 62, dressed in white among thousands of protesters who took to the streets against Maduro on Wednesday. “We are sick of this. It’s time to toughen up and do what we must to save Venezuela,” added Pinate, whose husband was fired from state oil company PDVSA by Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez and whose two children have gone abroad. After pinning its hopes on a referendum this year - which could have triggered a presidential election and put them in power after 17 years of leftist rule - the enraged opposition Democratic Unity coalition has taken its gloves off. It is holding a symbolic political trial of Maduro in the legislature, organizing daily street protests, and shunning talks with the government that had been announced by the Vatican for this weekend.  Recalling tactics that led to a short-lived coup against Chavez in 2002 and a shutdown of the oil industry, the coalition has also called for a general strike on Friday and a march to the Miraflores presidential palace next week.  “We’ve reached the limit,” said Henrique Capriles, a usually moderate opposition leader, calling the government “Satan.” “Does the opposition have anything to negotiate with the government? Nothing. Why does the government want dialogue? Because the water has risen to its neck,” he said.  Some hardliners, most notably veteran activist Maria Corina Machado and jailed protest leader Leopoldo Lopez’ wife Lilian Tintori, are calling for Gandhi-style civil disobedience.  The government is vowing an iron fist. It says well-known troublemakers, who were behind the 2002 putsch, are again seeking a coup against an elected government, with the help of the United States and compliant foreign media. “I fear nobody and nothing!” Maduro told red-shirted supporters at one of his daily rallies and TV appearances this week. The ruling Socialist Party’s No. 2, Diosdado Cabello said any companies heeding the strike call would be seized by workers and the military. “We’re not going to allow craziness.” Long proud of its democratic credentials after winning numerous elections under Chavez, the ruling Socialist Party says it is the opposition flouting Venezuela’s democracy given that independent institutions shot down the referendum. Officials also argue that the very existence of protests and virulent public criticism of Maduro prove democracy is alive and well in Venezuela. Maduro insists the referendum decision was made by independent judges and electoral officials based on technical criteria, and denies the Socialist Party had any sway over the result. But critics say both the judiciary and electoral council have long been in the government’s pocket. The Supreme Court has repeatedly shot down legislation  passed by the opposition-dominated Congress while interpreting the constitution to favor the executive branch and limit the reach of lawmakers. And the elections council has steadily shifted the requirements for requesting the recall vote. Maduro would have faced probable defeat and removal from power if the referendum had gone ahead.  His challenge now is to contain street protests and respond to deep anger among all Venezuelans at the dreadful state of the economy. Food shortages, long shopping lines and runaway prices have eroded the ruling “Chavismo” movement’s popularity among the poor and seen Maduro’s ratings slide to just over 20 percent.  But as unhappy as they are, disaffected former “Chavistas” are not yet ready to throw their lot in en masse with coalition leaders they still view with suspicion. “They are all from privileged families. How can they represent me?” said Orlando Diaz, 47, a mechanic and father of four from a slum in western Caracas who has seen work dry up and income tumble during a nearly three-year recession. “Do I hate Maduro? Yes. He has betrayed the comandante (Chavez), he is a fool. Will I join these people in their crying and marching? No way. Frankly, I don’t know where to turn. I don’t see a future, I just have to find bread for my family today and tomorrow. That’s all I think about.” The opposition’s challenge is how to incorporate people like Diaz and his neighbors from the gritty hillside Antimano “barrio”, into their street push. On Wednesday, they drew hundreds of thousands nationwide, but students and traditional supporters remained at the vanguard. Scores of people on both sides were killed during anti-Maduro protests in 2014 and there was new violence on Wednesday, with dozens of injuries and arrests. A policemen was shot dead in an incident the government blamed on demonstrators.  “A recall referendum in 2016 would have meant the automatic exit from power of ‘Chavismo’,” said local pollster Luis Vicente Leon. “Eschewing democratic codes and values, the government preferred to assume ... the risk of a popular reaction.” The next presidential election is due at the end of 2018 and most Venezuelans assume another candidate will emerge from within “Chavismo” instead of Maduro. But given the events of recent days, opposition supporters are beginning to wonder if that election will even take place.",politicsNews,"October 27, 2016 ",1

3974,New Jersey's Christie vetoes bill seeking Trump's tax returns,"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Monday vetoed a bill that would have required President Donald Trump to release his tax returns in order to run for re-election in the state, calling it “politics at its worst.” The Democrat-controlled state legislature had passed the bill in March in response to Trump’s refusal to make public his tax returns when he ran for president as a Republican last year. Under the law, any candidate for president or vice president could not appear on the ballot without releasing at least five years of returns. Before Trump, every major presidential candidate had done so voluntarily since the 1970s. Christie, who became one of Trump’s earliest high-profile backers after his own White House run fizzled and served on Trump’s transition team, said the legislation was an unconstitutional “form of therapy” for Democrats unwilling to accept Trump’s win over Democrat Hillary Clinton. “The hypocrisy and false outrage underlying this bill is stunning - even by Trenton standards,” he said in a statement accompanying the veto. New Jersey was the first of at least 20 states considering similar legislation to send a bill to its governor’s desk for consideration. The chairman of the state assembly’s judiciary committee, Democrat John McKeon, called Christie’s comments “grandstanding and childish rhetoric.” “This much is clear – Governor Christie is obsessed with protecting and showing allegiance to President Trump,” McKeon added in a statement. “Sad!” The state Senate majority leader, Democrat Loretta Weinberg, said voters “deserve to know what financial ties and interests candidates for the presidency and vice presidency have, including with other countries.” Trump’s critics have said his tax returns represent the only way to assess any potential conflicts of interest related to his sprawling business empire. Democrats have also suggested the returns could reveal politically damaging information, such as Trump’s possible use of loopholes to avoid paying income taxes. During the campaign, Trump said he would not release the returns because he was being audited, and the White House has made it clear he has no intention of doing so after winning the election.",politicsNews,"May 1, 2017 ",1

The man was captured, and a police officer and female bystander were reportedly injured, but not seriously. The gunman was also injured and was taken to the hospital.The gunman reportedly tried to go through metal detectors with the weapon. When the detectors went off, and security confronted the man, he pulled out his gun, when he was shot by a police officer.The Capitol and buildings in the area were placed on lockdown for roughly half an hour, causing some confusion as there was a lockdown drill in the Capitol earlier this morning. The visitor center is still closed, but the House and Senate reopened for official business purposes only. Although Congress is not currently in session due to a break for Easter, Washington DC is flooded with tourists this time of year for its annual Cherry Blossom Festival.The incident was deemed as isolated by local police.The visitor center at the Capitol was built via an underground center with high security after two Capitol police officers were killed in 1998 by a paranoid schizophrenic who entered the building and opened fire in 1998. Similar incidents have historically occurred at the Capitol as it is a high target for gunmen who want to ensure they receive national media attention.In April 2015, a male entered the Capitol building with a gun and committed suicide.Details from the Capitol shooting today are still emerging as to who the shooter is, what is plans were, and what were his motives for trying to bring a gun into the Capitol.Featured image courtesy of Flickr",News,"March 28, 2016",1
22023,Zakharova Slams CIA Chief Pompeo: Stop Making Up Anti-Russian Fiction,"21st Century Wire says With the ongoing hysteria constantly spouting from the American mainstream media about alleged  Russian meddling  in the 2016 election which saw Donald Trump elected as president of the United States, the world is still awaiting a single shred of real evidence to support the establishment s conspiracy theory. To date, none has surfaced. The intelligence community has said that this election was meddled with by the Russians in a way that frankly is not particularly original. They ve been doing this for an awfully long time, and we are decades into the Russians trying to undermine American democracy,  CIA chief Mike Pompeo told MSNBC s Hugh Hewitt in an exclusive interview that aired Saturday, June 24.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, has made a noteworthy response to Pompeo s comments.via Russia InsiderTranslation: We could not but take note of and comment on the June 24 statement by CIA Director Mike Pompeo during his NBC interview. The statement dealt with Russia s alleged long time attempts to undermine the American democracy and meddling in the US elections. It appears that in his opinion Russia s longtime attempts to undermine the US democracy have culminated in the interference in US elections. As we know the issue of Russia s meddling in the election process has become a favorite media story and an obsession in the United States. This story has been adopted by anti-Russia propagandists. This issue continues to pick up momentum and is mentioned in statements by officials who are trying to accuse Russia of engaging in unlawful actions but who have failed to produce any evidence to date.We would like to remind them about some outstanding pages of US history. Unlike the Americans, we have real facts at our disposal, and we know what we should focus on. It is common knowledge that since the early 1990s the United States had voiced its intentions to establish a Jeffersonian democracy in Russia. But the very fact of setting such a task completely runs counter to the ideas of Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the American nation and democracy. All of us know he called for respecting various forms of government, chosen by other nations and said the United States would not impose its will anywhere. He was mistaken. Thomas Jefferson referred to the idea of dictating the form of government to an independent country as arrogant, brutal and outrageous.It appears that the ideologists of the present-day America have very poor knowledge of their own history and the foundations of their statehood, if the concepts of  exporting democracy  and  humanitarian intervention  have become their favorite method for conducting an aggressive foreign policy as part of their national concept. For decades, dozens of countries all over the world have been suffering from US-imposed sate system formulas they are trying to equate all countries under one and the same pattern, without any consideration for what makes each of them unique. This policy and experiments cannot be called harmless. In the past few years Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Syria and Ukraine have fallen prey to this concept. Needless to say, al-Qaeda in all its manifestations, ISIS and other radical terrorist groups of all religious denominations evolved on the fertile soil created by the Americans and in fact often were the brainchildren of these forces.Generous financial injections in the form of projects and grants through numerous foundations and NGOs is another  grey zone  through which the United States has been trying to influence political processes all over the world for many years. Russia virtually tops the list of these allocations. Various government and non-government organizations, including the Peace Corps, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute and many other similar agencies, have been planting their agents for decades in order to penetrate the Russian political establishment and media community and to influence public opinion. According to some sources, the US has spent 5 Billion dollars for these purposes in the 1990s alone. It is very strange that, while making such statements, Mr. Pompeo forgets that many decisions stipulating the allocation of funding were approved by his own agency. It is strange that Washington forgets the fact that in the run-up to the 1996 Russian presidential election, the Federal Reserve bank delivered $500 million in cash to the US Embassy in Moscow under a far-fetched pretext of avoiding frenzied demand during the exchange of old $100 notes. Operatives from the CIA s Moscow Embassy station, headed by Michael Sulick, virtually slept on the money bags, while guarding them. Foreign-made cars delivered small batches of money from the Embassy to certain individuals.Who did the US sponsor using this money? I believe we will also learn this someday. I do not mean our assumptions, everything is clear here  Well will know the specific names, dates and so on. Here are only a few examples of diverse US activities aiming to undermine stability in various regions worldwide and in those areas that are not ready to follow American instructions. We are in no way demanding that Mr. Pompeo should stop his rhetoric because this is in the realm of fiction. One should simply understand that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. We are ready. READ MORE RUSSIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russia FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"August 21, 2017",0
9529,'The Wire' actor Pierce arrested after scuffle over Democratic politics,"Actor Wendell Pierce, who starred in HBO’s “The Wire,” was arrested in Atlanta over the weekend and charged with battery after an altercation sparked by differences in opinion about the U.S. presidential race, police said on Monday. The incident occurred early Saturday morning after Pierce, a Hillary Clinton backer, got into a political debate with a couple at the Loews Atlanta Hotel, according to an Atlanta Police Department arrest report. Media reports said the couple supported Clinton rival Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination. The police report said Pierce followed the couple through the hotel and tried to force his way into their room, and also that he pulled the woman’s hoodie off and hit her in the head. Pierce denied the allegations, police said, and no one needed medical attention. Pierce’s representatives could not be reached for comment. On Monday, Rutgers University-Newark said Pierce had withdrawn as the speaker for the school’s commencement this week, citing the incident. Pierce declined to give the address “in order to assure that commencement 2016 will be a celebration of the accomplishments of our students, free from distractions,” the school said in a statement, adding that journalist Soledad O’Brien would replace him as speaker. “In addition to his role as Baltimore police detective Bunk Moreland on HBO’s critically acclaimed ‘The Wire,’ Pierce, 52, is also known for roles on television shows including “Treme” and “The Odd Couple” as well as the film “Selma.”  He was arrested early on Saturday and released after posting a $1,000 bond, according to police and jail records.

14507,"Two weeks to unlock Brexit, EU tells May","There is more work to be done  to unlock Brexit talks, British Prime Minister Theresa May was told on Friday, as the European Union repeated an early December deadline for her to move on the divorce bill and border with Ireland. May met fellow leaders on the sidelines of an EU summit in Gothenburg, Sweden, to try to break the deadlock over how much Britain will pay on leaving the bloc in 16 months. She signalled again that she would increase an initial offer that is estimated at some 20 billion euros, about a third of what Brussels wants. But without any immediate plans to detail which financial commitments Britain was planning to cover and with a growing row with Ireland over their shared border, European Council President Donald Tusk, who coordinates Brexit for the bloc s other 27 leaders, concluded Britain must take further steps. He increased the pressure on May to make progress by early  December, in time for the EU to react at a summit on Dec. 14-15, or risk losing a chance to push the talks to a discussion of future trade ties, something London desperately wants so it can offer some certainty to nervy businesses. Asked about Brexit minister David Davis complaining that Britain had made  all the running  in finding compromises on the third key divorce issue   the rights of expatriate citizens, Tusk said pointedly:  I can say only that I really appreciate Mr. Davis s English sense of humour.   He told the news conference:  While good progress on citizens has been made, we need to see much more progress on Ireland and on the financial settlement.  In order to avoid any ambiguity about our work calendar, I made it very clear to prime minister May that this progress needs to happen at the beginning of December at the latest.  It was an echo of the ultimatum issued by the EU s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who a week ago gave Davis until the end of the month to detail the British approach to the financial settlement   and effectively increase the money on the table. But Tusk, who met May earlier on Friday, added another demand - more progress on the future status of the border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which Britain says is almost impossible to make without discussing the future trade deal as that would determine the kind of customs needed. Under pressure at home from members of parliament in her own party who are concerned she is preparing for Britain to walk away with no deal and from the EU, May has tried to gloss over the differences and emphasise how far the talks have come.  We ve agreed that good progress has been made. More does need to be done. But we re clear, and I m clear, that what we need to do is move forward together and that is how we can ensure that we are going to get the best deal for the United Kingdom and the European Union,  May told reporters. But a growing row with Ireland broke into the open on Friday, with Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney saying Dublin was not ready to allow the talks to move onto a discussion of future trade next month. Prime Minister Leo Varadkar went further.  I can t say in any honesty that it s close on the Irish issue or on the financial settlement,  he told Sky News.  After 40 years of marriage, most of them good, now Britain wants a divorce but an open relationship the day after.  With German Chancellor Angela Merkel absent from the summit because of government formation talks in Berlin, it was left to French President Emmanuel Macron to speak for the heavyweight powers which are taking a tough line with London:  We won t change the agreed process in any way, and we won t open talks on the future relationship as long as the conditions set in the first phase have not been met,  he said Sweden. But May, weakened after losing her Conservative Party s majority at a June election she did not need to call, has little room for manoeuvre. Some of her team of ministers are pressing her to hold off from naming a figure, seeing it as one of the few levers Britain has to press for better trade deal. Despite the tough language, Tusk offered some hope.  I feel much better, safer after my meeting with Theresa May, everything is possible,  the former Polish premier said.  There was very visibly goodwill on both sides. We still have a chance to achieve our first goal   to achieve the finalisation of the first phase of negotiations. I am very cautious.

7244,Canadian Company Offers Asylum To Americans Looking To Escape Donald Trump (IMAGES),"A Canadian tech company is capitalizing on Donald Trump s scary rise to the top by offering refuge to American workers in the field of technology.Sortable, based out of Kitchener, Ontario, has started as a brand new automated ad company that aims to make  ads suck less.  I first ran across Sortable while scrolling down my Facebook newsfeed. The business is paying for advertising on the social media network and their ad made me laugh out loud:Sortable says they want to offer people in the tech industry a safe place to live and work if Donald Trump is elected president. Now, while we don t think Americans will actually move en masse to Canada if the election doesn t go their way, we do want to extend an offer. Because it s the polite, Canadian thing to do Over the last year, Sortable s popularity has followed a similar trajectory to Trump s. We have been growing 40% month over month, and our ad engine is handling 3 billion ad impressions each month. While Donald Trump has been really bad for America, he is actually proving to be quite profitable for our Northern neighbor. Sortable isn t the first Canadian entity to offer their country up as an alternative option if Trump is elected. Recently an island in the country also announced they would welcome us with arms wide open if the billionaire somehow manages to bamboozle his way into the White House. Further, the anti-Trump sentiment across America has given the country a noticable bump in tourism.Sortable s founder Christopher Reid said he began the ad campaign after watching the progression of the United States  presidential election: It s bizarre and it s funny and we thought, why not use that as an opportunity to sort of promote the fact that we re hiring aggressively and we re looking globally. We re doing it because we need to find people and it s fun. What s perhaps even funnier than the campaign to lure American workers to the company, is their attempt to bring Canadians, who are working in Silicon Valley, back home:While it is funny to watch Canadian businesses and towns use Donald Trump s rise to power to advertise, it s also really embarrassing for America. We are quickly becoming a laughingstock around the world. It was bad enough when our allies were scratching their heads and wondering why we have so many mass shootings while they have virtually none, but now we have Bozo the Clown running for president. Trump s steady flow of hate, bigotry and bullshit is damaging our already bruised reputation further.These kinds of ad campaigns further highlight how important it is that Democrats get off of their sofas and vote in November.

468,Democratic Representative Gutierrez hints at 2020 U.S. presidential run,"U.S. Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez, who has announced he will not seek re-election to Congress in 2018, said on Wednesday he wanted to concentrate his energies “on the national level” and indicated he might be interested in a presidential run in 2020.  Fox News reported earlier on Wednesday that Gutierrez was weighing such a bid. When asked by Reuters if he planned to run, Gutierrez, who has represented Chicago in the U.S. House of Representatives for the past quarter century, said he wanted to spend the first six months of 2018 touring the country “talking with as many people as possible.” “Does it mean going to Iowa? I certainly hope so,” Gutierrez said in an interview. Iowa traditionally holds the first Democratic and Republican party nominating contests for president. Candidates weighing presidential candidacies typically pay visits to the state well before they formally enter the race. “But it also means going to California and visiting farm workers there and visiting with farm workers in Florida ... and in Oregon and in Washington (state) and visiting with immigrant communities,” Gutierrez said. “I’m not retiring. I want to change my focus. I want to take my energy on a national level,” he said. “I can tell you that very, very clearly.”  Republican President Donald Trump already has expressed his intention to seek re-election in 2020. While incumbent presidents often are favored to win, Democrats see Trump as particularly vulnerable given his low approval ratings in opinion polls. That has spurred speculation that many candidates could weigh challenging him. Former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, for example, has sent signals that he may run. Gutierrez, a 63-year-old lawmaker of Puerto Rican descent,  has made immigration reform a signature issue. In August, he was arrested outside the White House while taking part in a protest against Trump’s decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protects young people brought to the United States illegally as children. Gutierrez has sharply criticized the Trump administration’s response to the devastation in Puerto Rico from Hurricanes Maria and Irma. Gutierrez said he would explore possible campaign fundraising efforts. Although he would run as a Democrat, he would not seek the blessing of the Democratic Party establishment. “I’m not talking to DNC (Democratic National Committee) officials. I’m not going to talk to anybody within the Democratic Party structures because what I want to do is create a party structure independent of the Democratic Party,” he said. Regardless of whether he seeks the White House, Gutierrez said he wanted to play a big role in 2020 helping to encourage voting and political activism among Hispanics, a growing demographic group that leans strongly Democratic. When word leaked out that he was retiring from Congress, there was speculation Gutierrez might be planning a run for governor of Puerto Rico. On Wednesday, Gutierrez rejected the idea. “If it was president of the Republic of Puerto Rico, it would certainly be different,” said Gutierrez, who favors independence for the U.S. territory.",politicsNews,"November 29, 2017 ",1
2488,Russia risks decades of low growth under U.S. sanctions: Putin adviser,"Russia risks being saddled with U.S. sanctions for decades, curbing economic growth and preventing it from regaining its status as a leading economic power, an adviser to President Vladimir Putin said in an interview. Alexei Kudrin told Reuters that the current proposed tightening of sanctions in Washington should not have any serious impact. But he called for a major structural reform program after the 2018 presidential election. He said that was the only way for Russia to return to growth of more than 2 percent a year. Putin has not yet said whether he will run for re-election next year, but is widely expected to do so and to win what would be a fourth term as president. Putin has tasked Kudrin, who has known Putin since they worked together in the St Petersburg Mayor’s Office in the 1990s, with devising a strategy to lift Russian economic growth after 2018. Whereas Putin oversaw several years of growth in excess of 5 percent in his early presidential terms, the Russian economy suffered two years of contraction in 2015 and 2016 and is forecast to grow by a little over 1 percent this year. In May GDP rose by 3.1 percent year on year, but that pace is not expected to last. The slowdown has put Putin under pressure. U.S. lawmakers earlier this week voted to impose new sanctions on Russia — on top of earlier penalties over its role in the Ukraine conflict — and Kudrin said the mood in Washington meant it would be difficult for U.S. President Donald Trump to ease sanctions in future. “In its current form the tightening of sanctions under discussion wouldn’t seriously affect the Russian economy, there aren’t serious changes with the version that exists. But the hope that sanctions would be canceled in the coming years has now faded,” Kudrin said. “We are likely to end up with the story with the old Jackson-Vanik amendment — even when all the conditions had already changed, they couldn’t cancel it,” he said. Jackson-Vanik, a 1974 provision to a U.S. federal law that punished former Communist bloc countries for restricting human rights, was only repealed in 2012 under previous U.S. President Barack Obama. It was a major sticking point in relations between Moscow and Washington. Trump was widely perceived to be the Kremlin’s favored candidate in last year’s U.S. presidential race, and his White House victory raised hopes in Moscow that sanctions could be relaxed as early as this year. But Trump’s administration has since become bogged down in investigations into possible ties between his campaign and Russia. Trump has said his campaign did not collude with Russia, which flatly denies allegations it meddled in the U.S. vote. Kudrin, who served as finance minister from 2000 to 2011, won praise from foreign investors for building up Russia’s formidable fiscal buffers during an era of high oil prices. He  was one of relatively few liberal voices among top officials. He now heads the Centre for Strategic Research, an analytical group founded on Putin’s initiative to draft policy ideas. Kudrin said Western sanctions in their current configuration were knocking off around 0.5 percent from Russian gross domestic product, down from 1 percent in the year after they were introduced in 2014. Russia had a “window of opportunity” after the 2018 election in which to enact meaningful reforms to counteract the effects of sanctions, he said. But for now a populist camp around Putin appeared to have the upper hand over those calling for reform. “To what extent the president will use that [window], we don’t know,” Kudrin said. “After previous elections that window for reforms wasn’t used.” Among the reforms Kudrin is calling for are greater public control over law enforcement officials, raising the retirement age, reducing government stakes in large companies, and improving revenue collection from the shadow economy. He said he thought the state should sell government stakes in Russian oil companies in stages over the next six to 10 years, and that it could sell a portion of its majority holding in the country’s largest bank Sberbank in the same time period. With such reforms, Kudrin said Russia could increase its economic growth rate to 3-4 percent in five to six years, even with sanctions staying in place.

15666,Australia turns down NZ offer to take asylum seekers barricaded inside camp,"Australia turned down on Sunday an offer to take 150 asylum seekers being held in an Australian-run detention center in Papua New Guinea, where U.N. officials have warned a humanitarian emergency is unfolding. About 600 men have barricaded themselves inside the camp on remote Manus island in Papua New Guinea, defying efforts by Australia and PNG to shut it. Food, running water and medical services were cut off by Australia five days ago. Australian authorities want the men moved to a transit center elsewhere on the island at the start of a process the asylum seekers fear will result in them being resettled in PNG or another developing nation. The men also fear violent reprisals from the local community. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Friday her country was willing to take 150 asylum seekers from among those held on Manus island and another camp on the tiny Pacific nation of Nauru. Her Australian counterpart, Malcolm Turnbull, however said Canberra preferred to work through an existing refugee swap deal he negotiated with former U.S. President Barack Obama last year. Under that deal, up to 1,250 asylum seekers could be sent to the United States and Australia will in turn accept refugees from Central America.  We want to pursue those, conclude those arrangements, and then in the wake of that obviously we can consider other ones,  Turnbull told Ardern during a media conference in Sydney. Relocating the men on Manus island is designed as a temporary measure, allowing the United States time to complete vetting of asylum seekers.  Ardern acknowledged the two Tasman neighbors faced different immigration problems but said the offer remained open. The camps on Manus island and Nauru have been key parts of Australia s disputed  Sovereign Borders  immigration policy, under which it refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores. Australia s offshore detention policies have been heavily criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups but are backed the center-right government and the Labor opposition. U.N. rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a news conference in Geneva on Friday about the  unfolding humanitarian emergency  in the Manus island center, where asylum seekers have been reported digging wells to try to find water.",worldnews,"November 5, 2017 ",0
8116,Chuck Schumer DESTROYS Ted Cruz Over Vow To Block Obama SCOTUS Nominee (VIDEO),"Senator Chuck Schumer ( D- NY) is furious with Ted Cruz, and with good reason. Like many Republicans, Cruz has helped circle the wagons in the wake of the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and has promised to block anyone President Obama might appoint. Of course, all of those extremist windbags on the right want another far-right nut like Antonin Scalia on the Court   but there s a catch. President Obama has every right to nominate a person of his choosing, which will ensure a Supreme Court with liberal leanings. The GOP-controlled Senate, however, will do all they can to make sure that doesn t happen, though, and they have said so openly, thus leading to Sen. Schumer s fury.Appearing on This Week on Sunday morning, the Senator laid into Cruz s plans: Well, the job, first and foremost, is for the president to nominate and for the Senate to hold hearings and go through the process. You know, the Constitution, Ted Cruz holds the Constitution when he walks through the halls of Congress. Let him show me the clause that says president s only president for three years. After making his point about Cruz, Schumer then turned his attentions to Mitch McConnell s obstructionism. You know, the kind of obstructionism that Mitch McConnell s talking about, he s harking back to his old days, you know, he recently he said, well,  I want regular order.  But in 2010, right after the election or right during the election, he said,  My number one job is to defeat Barack Obama,  without even knowing what Barack Obama was going to propose. Here, he doesn t even know who the president s going to propose and he said,  no, we re not having hearings, we re not going to go forward to lead the Supreme Court vacant at 300 days in a divided time. This kind of obstructionism isn t going to last. And you know, we Democrats didn t do this. We voted 97-0 for Justice Kennedy in the last year of Reagan s term. I think first the American people don t like this obstruction. When you go right off the bat and say,  I don t care who he nominates, I am going to oppose him,  that s not going to fly. Indeed it s not going to fly. These people hate the sitting President so much that they are willing to leave a vacant seat on the court before they let anyone he might nominate through. Senator Schumer is right   no reasonable American would go for this. Let Cruz and the rest of the GOP hang themselves with this one, though. It will only be a matter of time.Watch the clip below, as posted to Twitter by ABC:WATCH: @SenSchumer to @tedcruz:  Show me the clause that says the president is only president for three years.  https://t.co/YJdZr3ZDTM  This Week (@ThisWeekABC) February 14, 2016Featured image from video screen capture via Raw Story",News,"February 14, 2016",1
4,Trump wants Postal Service to charge 'much more' for Amazon shipments,"President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge “much more” to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     “Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president’s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the “Amazon Washington Post” fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump’s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. “We do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,” he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers’ doorsteps. Amazon’s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump’s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its “productive relationship” with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service’s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump’s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service’s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue.",politicsNews,"December 29, 2017 ",1
2507,"Senate advances on healthcare, with dramatic return by McCain","U.S. Senate Republicans narrowly agreed on Tuesday to open debate on a bill to end Obamacare, but the party’s seven-year effort to roll back Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law still faces significant hurdles. The Senate deadlocked 50-50 on moving forward with the healthcare debate, forcing Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote. Senator John McCain, who was diagnosed this month with brain cancer and has been recovering from surgery at home in Arizona, made a dramatic return to the U.S. Capitol to cast a crucial vote in favor of proceeding. The outcome was a huge relief for President Donald Trump, who had pushed his fellow Republicans hard in recent days to live up to the party’s campaign promises to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. Minutes after the vote, Trump called it “a big step.” But the narrow victory on a simple procedural matter raised questions about whether Republicans can muster the votes necessary to pass any of the various approaches to repeal. Moderates are worried repeal will cost millions of low-income Americans their insurance and conservatives are angry the proposed bills do not go far enough to gut Obamacare, which they consider government overreach. In a first vote of the many likely to come this week, the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare that Senate Republicans have been working on for months failed to get the 60 votes needed for approval on Tuesday night. The vote was 43 in favor and 57 against. Nine Republicans, ranging from moderates such as Susan Collins of Maine to conservatives such as Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against the bill, which would have made deep cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, and reduced Obamacare subsidies to lower-income people to help them defray the cost of health insurance. Earlier McCain, 80, received an ovation from his fellow senators when he entered the chamber to cast a vote to open debate. After that vote, he decried growing partisanship in the Senate and urged members to learn how “to trust each other again.” Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski were the only Republicans to oppose the measure to open debate, and with Republicans controlling the Senate by a 52-48 majority, those were the only votes the party leadership could afford to lose. Democrats were united in opposition to the motion to proceed. Republican Senator Ron Johnson, who cast the last and deciding vote to open debate, engaged in a heated discussion with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell before casting his vote and ending the suspense. A loss on the vote to open debate on Tuesday could have been a death blow for Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare and cast doubt on Trump’s prospects to achieve any of his other top legislative agenda items, including tax reform. “We have a duty to act,” McConnell told senators before the vote, reminding Republicans they had promised to repeal Obamacare in four straight elections. “We can’t let this moment slip by.” Republicans have found it difficult to fulfill their campaign promises to repeal Obamacare, which enabled 20 million more Americans to get health insurance. Polls show Obamacare is now far more popular than the Republican alternatives. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the Senate’s replacement bill could lead to as many as 22 million fewer Americans being insured. The health industry has watched the debate nervously, and after the vote some groups urged the Senate to reconsider its approach. America’s Essential Hospitals, a group representing safety-net hospitals, said in a statement it strongly opposed all the Republican plans and feared the big cuts in Medicaid in the bills “would jeopardize the health and financial security of millions of working people and families.” Shares in health insurer Centene Corp (CNC.N) turned sharply lower after the Senate vote. Earlier on Tuesday, the company had reported a better than expected profit as it benefits from a strong Obamacare business.     As the debate vote opened, more than two dozen protesters in the Senate chamber chanted “kill the bill” before they were removed. Senators said several approaches have been discussed, including a straight repeal of Obamacare with no replacement plan, or repealing and replacing the law while also overhauling Medicaid. Senate Republicans also could consider a shortened version of repeal, called a “skinny repeal,” which would end the mandates in Obamacare on individuals and employers to obtain or provide health insurance, and a medical device tax, a Senate aide and a lobbyist said. “Some of us want clean repeal, some of us want the Senate leadership bill, they’re both going to get a vote early on and I think that’s a fair way to do it,” Republican Senator Rand Paul said. “If either one of them fails and another one succeeds, maybe we can find something in between that actually succeeds.” Republican Senator Bob Corker said the goal was to gain enough votes to get a bill through the Senate and send it to the House of Representatives, which passed its own bill to replace Obamacare in May, for negotiations. “Everybody understands this is just a first step,” he said. Several of the Democrats opposing the motion for debate were from conservative states that backed Trump in 2016 and face tough re-election bids next year, including Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana. “We have a good chance to beat this,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters after the vote. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, praised Collins and Murkowski for taking a principled stand against the Republican move to open debate. “That wasn’t easy,” Durbin said. “That was an act of political courage on their part; I’m sure they were under tremendous pressure.”",politicsNews,"July 25, 2017 ",0
20485,South Africa's Ramaphosa steps up criticism ahead of ANC leadership vote,"South African Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a leading contender to become head of the ruling ANC in December, stepped up his criticism of the government on Sunday, saying state-owned companies had been  captured  and funds looted from them. Ramaphosa s remarks during a speech to an African National Congress meeting in the old diamond-mining town of Kimberley  were tougher than others he has made on government graft, signaling the issue will be a main theme of his campaign.  He also took aim   without naming them - at the wealthy Gupta family, friends of President Jacob Zuma who have been accused of using undue influence to win lucrative state contracts. Zuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing.  Many of these state-owned enterprises have been captured by certain people, by a certain family,  Ramaphosa said.   All of our state-owned enterprises have been captured and we are saying we want to see an end to state capture and the money that has been stolen, we want it back,  he said, to roars of approval from the audience.  South Africa s top prosecutor said on Wednesday police were examining a trove of leaked documents detailing relations between the Guptas and Zuma, but it was too early to say if a prosecution should be launched. Ramaphosa said in May that South Africa was in danger of becoming a  mafia state  and he took a swipe in July at the Guptas over media reports that state funds were diverted in 2013 to pay for a lavish Gupta family wedding. But Sunday s remarks about a  certain family  were more pointed and come as the race heats up for the ANC s top spot. The next head of the party, who will be selected in December, will be its presidential candidate in 2019 national elections. Ramaphosa s main challenger, veteran politician and Zuma s ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, will next week be sworn in as a member of parliament, a move which could see the former minister brought back into the cabinet, raising her profile. Analysts say she has the backing of Zuma s well-established patronage network as well as organizations such as the party s Women s League. Ramaphosa is a trade unionist-turned-business tycoon who has the backing of a diverse group of unions, communists and investors who do not always see eye to eye but want to rid the ANC of Zuma s influence and legacy.  The opposition has long accused Zuma of sleaze and influence-peddling while in office. He survived a no-confidence vote in parliament on Aug. 8 but 30 ANC lawmakers voted with the opposition, indicating deep divisions in the party that has dominated South African politics since the end of apartheid in 1994.",worldnews,"September 10, 2017 ",1

16600,Italy calls confidence votes in Senate on new electoral law,"Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni s government on Tuesday called a series of confidence votes to pass a new electoral law as the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which is likely to be hurt by the new legislation, pledged to protest on the streets. The government is resorting to the confidence votes to avoid secret voting in the Senate, where it has a narrow majority and at least four members of the ruling Democratic Party have said they will not cast a ballot. The confidence votes will be held by open ballot starting on Wednesday afternoon, with the final confidence vote to be held on Thursday. The government is forced to resign if it loses such a vote.  A centrist group that is not formally part of the government s majority has said it will provide up to 10 votes to help pass the law if needed. The bill, dubbed the Rosatellum, is supported by the Democratic Party (PD) and mainstream center-right opposition parties. It favors parties which group together ahead of the election.  It is likely to hurt 5-Star, which refuses to join any alliance, and left-wing parties that do not want to join a coalition with the PD. The 5-Star Movement, which tops many opinion polls, has called a street protest in front of the Senate for Wednesday afternoon, against what it sees as an attempt by its mainstream rivals to scupper its chances at the election.  It will be joined by the leftist Democratic and Progressive Movement (MDP), which split from the PD this year, and other small left-wing groups.   Apart from the PD, the legislation is supported by Silvio Berlusconi s center-right Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the right-wing Northern League. The Rosatellum is the best compromise possible among political adversaries, according to the PD parliamentary party leader, Ettore Rosato, after whom the reform has been named. In two separate rulings, the Constitutional Court struck down previous laws, leaving the upper and lower houses with different rules. President Sergio Mattarella has called on parliament to come up with a mew electoral law that applies equally to both houses before a national vote, due by May of next year.  All previous attempts to harmonize the rules have failed, most recently in June when dissident deputies used a secret vote to up-end part of the proposed legislation. While the current law would harmonize rules for both houses, polls suggest it will not hand any coalition or party a clear mandate to govern.  The proposed election law would distribute almost two-thirds of the seats in parliament on a proportional basis, while a third would be decided in a first-past-the-post vote on specific candidates. Coalitions would need to get 10 percent of the national vote to get into parliament, while parties running alone would need only 3 percent. Candidates would be chosen by party chiefs.",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",0
5976,Trump says he wants to cut Navy submarines' price: Fox News interview,"U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States needs more submarines but he wants to buy them at a lower cost, resuming his push to get defense contractors to cut the prices they charge the Pentagon. “We’re lacking submarines and we’re going to build new submarines but the price is too high so I’m cutting the prices way down,” Trump said in an interview on Fox News to be broadcast later on Thursday. Two U.S.-based companies, General Dynamics Corp’s Electric Boat division and Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding, build the Navy’s nuclear-powered submarines. Neither General Dynamics nor Huntington Ingalls immediately responded to a request for comment. “We are working hard to drive down cost and are seeing the fruits of that labor,” a senior U.S. Navy official said in response to the Trump comments. “We have the most advanced submarines in the world - the more we buy, the more we will bring down the price,” the official said. Trump, who took office on Friday, has vowed to build up the military, which he says has become dangerously depleted. Since winning the November election, he has pressured U.S. defense contractors to reduce the cost of the products they sell to the Pentagon. In December, Trump received a pledge from the chief executive of Lockheed Martin to cut the cost of the F-35 fighter jet after Trump complained in a tweet about the plane’s price tag and said he would ask Boeing to offer a cheaper alternative.",politicsNews,"January 27, 2017 ",0

During an appearance on CNN s  State of the Union,  McCain explained that he was bothered by a number of things involving Trump and Russia, including the strange removal of a call for defensive weapons to the Ukraine to defend against Russia from the official party platform. Clearly, it was not the will of most Republicans,  McCain told Jake Tapper Sunday, adding that there are plenty of shoes about to drop.  There s a lot of aspects with this whole relationship with Russia and Vladimir Putin that requires further scrutiny, and so far I don t think the American people have gotten all the answers. In fact, I think there s a lot of shoes to drop from this centipede.

4788,U.S. farm heartland lobbies to steer Trump away from Mexico trade war,"Farmers in the U.S. agricultural heartland that helped elect Donald Trump are now pushing his administration to avoid a trade dispute with Mexico, fearing retaliatory tariffs that could hit over $3 billion in U.S. exports. The value of exports at risk is based on a Reuters analysis of a tariff list which Mexico used in a trucking dispute six years ago and which Mexican officials have said could serve as a model if President Trump sets new barriers to Mexican goods.      Pork producers contacted Trump’s transition team soon after the Nov. 8 election to stress that tariff-free access to Mexico has made it their top export market by volume, said John Weber, president of the National Pork Producers Council. The council has sent the administration multiple letters, including one signed in January by 133 agricultural organizations, and is arranging for several hog farmers to fly to Washington next month to talk to officials. “We just keep pounding them on how critical trade is to us,” said Weber, who fears Mexico could revive the list of mostly agricultural products it successfully used to push Washington into letting Mexican truckers on U.S. highways in 2011.  Pork products topped that list and, if revived, the tariffs would apply to over $800 million of annual pork exports, according to data compiled by IHS Markit’s Global Trade Atlas. “We’ll be the first to take the hit,” Weber said.  The lobbying effort by U.S. businesses which rely on the Mexican market shows how Mexico can press its case in Washington despite having an economy 1/17 the size of America’s and relying on the U.S. market for nearly 80 percent if its exports. In Iowa, where pigs outnumber people seven to one, hog and grain farmer Jamie Schmidt voted for Trump in part on his promise to cut regulatory burdens for businesses. Now he and others who farm the flat, rich land around Garner, Iowa, worry about trade. Schmidt gets about half of his income from hogs, earning $4-5 for each of the 425 pigs he sells per week, usually to a Tyson Foods (TSN.N) packing plant in nearby Perry, Iowa.  Tariffs from Mexico could depress U.S. wholesale prices and wipe out his profits, Schmidt said. “It would be devastating.”  In December, after fears of a trade dispute fueled a deep peso MXN= slump, Mexico started mapping out U.S. states that are most reliant on its market, replicating the strategy it used in the trucking dispute, said two senior Mexican officials. Mexican officials also prepared briefs, seen by Reuters, on Mexico’s own risks in a dispute, including losing much of its cost advantage in building cars, such as the Ford Fusion (F.N) made in Hermosillo, Mexico.  Reuters could not verify a complete list of products and states Mexico considered targeting this time around. But the country’s foreign minister said last month tariffs could target Iowa, which raises a third of U.S. hogs and exports about a quarter of its pork production, $100 million of which went to Mexico last year. The minister also said tariffs could aim at Wisconsin, the center of U.S. cheese production, and has singled out Texas for its “notable” trade surplus with Mexico. All three states voted for Trump in the 2016 election, with the president taking Iowa and Wisconsin by slim margins. Trump has accused Mexico of destroying U.S. jobs and has vowed to leave the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico if he cannot renegotiate better terms with Mexico. United States went from running a small trade surplus with Mexico in the early 1990s to a $63 billion deficit in 2016. Besides pork, cheese was also a top target in the trucking dispute in which Mexico retaliated with tariffs against rules that banned its trucks from U.S. roads. Some $200 million in current annual exports of cheese would be targeted if the tariff list were revived, according to the IHS database, which the U.S. government uses to measure the impact of trade disputes. The full tariff list would apply to $3.25 billion in current U.S. exports. John Holevoet, the director of government affairs at Wisconsin’s Dairy Business Association, said he has attended multiple meetings with Wisconsin federal lawmakers this year where risks of Mexican trade were discussed. Weber of the pork producers group said he believed the Trump administration “gets it” when it comes to the vulnerability of U.S. farm exports. Republican Congressman Steve King, who represents Iowa’s agriculture-focused fourth district, also pointed out that Iowa’s role as the first state to hold presidential primaries helps keep farm interests in Washington’s view. But King told Reuters he was worried the White House is still not taking trade risks seriously enough.  A possible 20 percent tax on Mexican imports, which White House spokesman Sean Spicer has said could also pay for Trump’s proposed border wall, would cause a trade war, he said. King said he has been in contact with the White House on the matter but has yet to secure a one-on-one meeting with the president. “I’m making sure that here in Washington they know what this means.”",politicsNews,"March 22, 2017 ",0

18457,University of Nairobi closed as anger rises over police brutality,"Administrators closed Kenya s oldest university on Tuesday, citing fears for students  safety in a planned protest over police beatings at a campus demonstration last week. Kenyan police frequently face accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings from civilians and rights groups, but officers are rarely charged and almost never convicted.  Despite this, Kenya, an economic and transport hub in East Africa and a key Western ally in a volatile region, receives substantial financial support for its security services from international donors, including the United States and Britain.   Rights groups say at least 28 people were killed, mostly by police, in unrest following the Aug. 8 election, whose results were later nullified by the Supreme Court due to irregularities.  A re-run of the presidential vote is scheduled for Oct. 26 and the conduct of the police will be closely watched.  On Sept. 28, University of Nairobi students protested against the arrest of an opposition lawmaker. Police responded by entering dormitories and classrooms, dragging out students, beating them with clubs and firing tear gas, according to a Reuters witness. The university said 27 students were injured.  A police spokesman did not respond to requests for comment but a presidential spokesman told local radio on Monday that robbers were hiding among the students.  On Tuesday, students had planned to demonstrate against the beatings but instead administrators shut down the university.   The (University of Nairobi) Senate has decided to send the students home for their (own) safety,  John Orindi, the university s corporate affairs director, told Reuters. On Tuesday morning, riot policemen stood near a truck with water cannon outside the campus gates.  A 20-year-old veterinary student who did not want to be named for fear of retribution said students wanted the vice chancellor to resign  for allowing anti-riot police to enter campus and seriously injure students .

19117,HILARIOUS! LIBERALS STUNNED When Republican Guest Won’t Play Race-Baiting Game With MSNBC Host…Cuts Off Interview [VIDEO],"On Saturday, MSNBC s Joy Reid repeatedly attempted to race-bait former Republican congressman J.D. Hayworth on her show AM Joy. NewsBusters reported that the claims that Reid threw at Hayworth ranged from  false to misleading. Joy started out by asking if Hayworth had any  discomfort  that an  undocumented  woman walked into a courtroom to file a protection order against an abusive boyfriend (no mention of his residency status) and was met with ICE agents who arrested her (The job of an ICE agent is to arrest people who illegally cross our borders). An alternative version would be: A woman who has broken our laws, and living in our country ILLEGALLY, was arrested after walking into a courthouse to ask for the same protections afforded to taxpaying US citizens, after it was discovered that she is also a lawbreaker.However it wasn t until Hayworth exposed Reid s liberal hypocrisy by bringing up the fact that Elizabeth Warren is not Native-American that Reid flipped out and kicked the GOP guest off the show.",left-news,"Feb 19, 2017",0

7698,Getting North Korea to give up nuclear bomb probably 'lost cause': U.S. spy chief,"The U.S. policy of trying to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons “is probably a lost cause” and the best that could be hoped for is a cap on the country’s nuclear capability, the Director of U.S. National Intelligence James Clapper said on Tuesday. However, underscoring conflicting views in the Obama administration, the State Department said U.S. policy was unchanged and continued to be to seek the “verifiable denuclearization” of the Korean peninsula. President Barack Obama has repeatedly stated that the United States will never accept North Korean as a nuclear-armed state. Clapper made clear at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank in New York he did not think that the policy the administration has stuck to, in spite of repeated North Korean nuclear tests, was realistic. “I think the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause,” Clapper said at the  Council on Foreign Relations think tank in New York. “They are not going to do that - that is their ticket to survival.” Pyongyang has persisted with its missile and nuclear weapons programs, including a Sept. 9 nuclear explosion, despite strong international sanctions. Clapper said he got a good taste of how the world looks from North Korea’s viewpoint when he went to Pyongyang on a mission in 2014 to secure the release of two Americans. “They are under siege and they are very paranoid, so the notion of giving up their nuclear capability, whatever it is, is a non-starter with them,” he said. “The best we could probably hope for is some sort of a cap, but they are not going to do that just because we ask them. There’s going to have to be some significant inducements.” U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said he had not seen Clapper’s remarks but told a regular news briefing in Washington that the administration did not believe denuclearization was a lost cause. “No, nothing’s changed ... that’s not our position. Our policy objective is to seek to obtain a verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. That is the policy; that is both the goal and what we want to see and there is a way to do that.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked on Wednesday about Clapper’s remarks, said the best way to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue was still via talks. China and Russia have pushed for a resumption of six-party talks on denuclearization in North Korea. The talks, which also involve Japan, South Korea and the United States, have been on hold since 2008. Clapper also said it bothered him that the United States was not capitalizing on using information as a weapon against North Korea. “That’s something they worry about a lot ... That is a great vulnerability I don’t think we have exploited. Right now, we are kind of stuck on our narrative and they are kind of stuck on theirs.” Clapper was asked if he thought North Korea could mount a nuclear warhead on a missile that could reach the West Coast of the United States and reiterated the intelligence assessment that this had to be a “worst-case assumption.” He said North Korea had yet to test its KN08 intercontinental ballistic missile, so neither North Korea nor the United States knew whether it worked. “Nevertheless, we ascribe to them the capability to launch a missile that would have a weapon on it to reach parts of the United States, certainly including Alaska and Hawaii,” he said. “They could do it. We have to make the worst-case assumption here.”",politicsNews,"October 25, 2016 ",0
7168,Walmart Reports First Ever Drop In Revenue — Does Greed Finally Have A Limit?,"Walmart has become the perfect symbol of the corporate greed strangling much of the planet. From putting tens of thousands of mom and pop stores out of business, union-busting, gender wage discrimination and utilizing slave labor in developing nations, Walmart has used its power to make the lives of millions of people miserable. And that s BEFORE you include leeching billions in taxpayer money by forcing their workers to live off of government assistance. All so a handful of billionaires can get even richer.But it looks like unrestrained greed can only get you so far:For the first time ever   or at least since the company went public some 45 years ago   Walmart s revenues shrank from the year before, according to its annual financial filing released Wednesday.Walmart is clearly having trouble adapting its gigantic stores to the Internet age. To be sure, it is a retail juggernaut that brings in half a trillion dollars (that s right, trillion) in sales every year. And with more than 11,500 stores in 28 countries,there s no way it will disappear anytime soon. Though Walmart shares were a safe haven in the rocky start of 2016, investors are pricing in more weakness. The stock has fallen behind retail competitors and the broader market.In February, Walmart lowered its annual net sales growth forecast to  relatively flat,  from earlier guidance that called for an increase of as much as 4 percent (the company has pointed out that previous guidance didn t account for currency changes, which have stung the global retailer).Ironically, part of this drop in revenue is due to Walmart focusing less on cutting operating expenses (like those pesky  salaries  that workers are always complaining about) and actual increased the pay for 1.2 million workers earlier this year.While a Republican might point to this and scream,  AHA! PROOF that paying the peons, I mean  valuable employees,  more is BAD for business! , less insane people would point out that a workforce of 1.2 million people that have more money will almost certainly spend some of that money at a store that carries most of the stuff they need. Like, for instance, Walmart?These hypothetical less crazy people might also point out that paying 1.2 million people more money would boost the economy and that a healthier economy means more people have more money to spend at places like, for instance again, Walmart. Because let s be honest, Walmart is not paying more out of the goodness of its cold, calculating corporate heart.It s too much to hope that the embodiment of everything wrong with unrestrained capitalism will go out of business and, frankly, that would be an unemployment disaster, but we can hope for a steady decline and THEN a collapse. I would also be happy if Walmart s board simply had an epiphany that crushing the middle class is not a viable long term strategy. Sure, paying a living wage would mean the shareholders would make less money but if the alternative is eventually going out of business because there s not enough demand, it would be more than worth the short term sting.Either way, let s hope this dip in revenue is the start of something good for America and the world.Featured image via AI archives",News,"April 1, 2016",0
17267,BUSTED: THE ULTIMATE COMMUNIST ORGANIZER…Evidence Shows George Soros Behind Ferguson Race Riots,"George, Barack and Hillary the axis of evil Professional race activists Deray McKesson and Johnetta Elzie (ShordeeDooWhop), pictured here in Baltimore, helped whip up the Ferguson mobs. This year Fortune Magazine named these two professional activists two of the world s greatest leaders.Many conservatives rightly smelled a rat in the supposed organic race-riot movement that sprang up so quickly in Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014 after the shooting death of robber Michael Brown. After burning the Ferguson and Dellwood, Missouri business districts to the ground the radical left has relentlessly sought to recreate the same discord and disinformation in various locations around the U.S. Ferguson #BlackLivesMatter protest leaders have been flown to New York, South Carolina, Milwaukee, Selma, and more recently to McKinney, Texas and Hillary s campaign relaunch in New York.Thankfully, every day patriots and online conservative investigators still fight to shine truth, anywhere  the movement  tries to sow its twisted seeds to foment anger, feed bitterness, and breed division.Much has been printed about the paid protesters and Soros connections.** Nearly half of the roughly 500 businesses operating in Ferguson and adjacent communities, such as Dellwood and Jennings, suffered property damage or lost revenue as a result of the coordinated Ferguson protests and riots.In May black Ferguson activists staged a protest at the office of MORE (Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment) to complain that the group s white leaders collected tens of thousands of dollars in donations off of the Black Lives Matter movement without paying the Black participants their fair share. It was during these protests that Ferguson activists admitted that fellow protesters were making MORE THAN $5,000 a month to disrupt cities, damage property and attack police!In response to these protests MORE released a list of names and amounts paid out to protesters and protest groups who agitated and harassed police night-after-night in Ferguson last fall and winter.The list of over 80 groups and individuals was posted on Twitter by an irate protester. Via Weasel ZippersOne of the protest leaders who showed up in Ferguson shortly after Michael Brown s death was DeRay McKesson from Minneapolis. DeRay and fellow activist Johnetta Elzie (ShordeeDooWhop) were nationally recognized and celebrated by the liberal media as two of the top stars of the violent protest mob.We now know that DeRay McKesson has been working with and for Soros-funded groups since he was in junior high school. We know this because DeRay released his resume online this past weekend.DeRay says he s been living off of savings for the past nine months as he s turned up in Ferguson, Baltimore, New York City, Milwaukee, Selma, McKinney and this past weekend he was at Hillary Clinton s campaign relaunch in New York state.DeRay and Charles Wade, Solange Knowles s stylist, the founder of Op Help or Hush have known each other for three years. Wade and McKesson were regular Ferguson protesters. That means the two have been affiliated well before Michael Brown went on his crime spree. DeRay has used his capacity, as Charles calls it, to push  the movement s  agenda far and wide.DeRay has long been known for his skill at  community organizing .He served as president of his class at Bowdoin College, as well as president of Bowdoin Student Government. While at Bowdoin, DeRay reportedly grew close to Bowdoin President Barry Mills, whose wife, Karen Gordon Mills, served in the Obama Administration. DeRay just happened to stay on the couch of an unnamed Bowdoin alum when he first descended on Ferguson.After graduating from Bowdoin, DeRay worked for the Harlem Children s Zone, run by none other than Bowdoin alums Druckenmiller and Geoffrey Canada. Coincidentally, Geoffrey served on the Open Society Institute s board.Throwback, meeting HCZ's Geoff Canada. pic.twitter.com/ocyw6Yo57q  deray mckesson (@deray) February 16, 2015DeRay also worked for  the movement  linked Teach For America, another radical Soros-funded group.But DeRay s ties to Soros and  community organizing  seemingly date back even further, to McKesson s teen years, at least. Suffice it to say, DeRay has been tied to Soros for more than a decade, through many programs.Perhaps DeRay s long and numerous apparent ties to Soros explain how he was so quickly dispatched to Ferguson, Missouri to take control of the protesters and become the powerfuls  approved and promoted voice on the ground. As DeRay said,  People will come out into the streets to confront a system that is corrupt.  Yet, DeRay seems to be molded, directed, and funded by some of the most powerful men in that very  system.  It looks as if someone may be pulling the strings behind the scenes to foment rage as this astroturf anti-police movement spreads from Ferguson to other points in America.Via: Gateway PunditAND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST...Here s Deray throwing his support behind Hillary on Twitter!

8955,NRA Thugs Threaten Lawmakers With Bullets For Sponsoring Bill Limiting Purchase Of Ammo (IMAGE),"As President Obama rolls out executive orders to strengthen background checks to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, two New York lawmakers are being threatened by the NRA for introducing legislation to restrict the sale of ammunition.The bill would limit the amount of ammo a person can purchase over a 90-day stretch and would ban gun dealers from selling ammunition to people who are prohibited from buying guns.The NRA, of course, is not happy about the legislation sponsored by state Senator Roxanne Persaud and Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon.But rather than simply protest, the thugs over at the National Rifle Association decided to pull a Sarah Palin and make targets of the pair of Democrats.In a Twitter post by NRA publication  America s 1st Freedom,  pictures of both lawmakers are taped to a board as if someone is preparing to use their images for target practice. To make it even more threatening, bullets are scattered next to the pictures in what appears to be an attempt to incite gun violence against them. Underneath the image, the NRA whines that the measure is a  ridiculous anti-gun scheme. Here s a screenshot of the tweet.The image comes nearly five years to the day a congresswoman was forced to leave office after being attacked by a deranged shooter.As you ll recall, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was nearly assassinated by a gunman after Sarah Palin posted a map on Facebook with crosshair symbols denoting which lawmakers conservatives should target because of their support of gun control. The map, which still exists on Palin s Facebook page, served as a  hit list  and caused national outrage. Giffords survived despite being shot in the head, but the NRA seems to be hoping for a repeat.Persaud and Simon blasted the image as an attempt to intimidate and threaten them into bowing down to gun nuts. I think it is irresponsible in the times that we are living in to place a target around someone,  Persaud told the Daily News.  By placing someone s picture with bullets next to them, you are playing on the fears of people. The New York Daily News reports:Persaud said the picture has  the potential to cause harm  because you don t know if a psycho who is upset about the proposal will react to something like that.Simon slammed the tweet for inciting gun nuts, who have been sending threats to both lawmakers since they proposed the legislation last month. They are clearly trying to be intimidating and it is not working,  she said.The Daily News also reports that NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams condemned the tweet as well.Once again, the NRA is acting like the terrorist organization it has become over the years. Even a veiled threat against lawmakers is outrageous and should not be tolerated in this country. If a gun nut does end up taking a shot at Persaud or Simon, the blame should be placed squarely on the NRA.Featured Image: Raw Story",News,"January 5, 2016",0
7299,Zuckerberg again rejects claims of Facebook impact on U.S. election,"Facebook Inc chief executive Mark Zuckerberg again rejected the idea that the social network affected the U.S. presidential election, saying late Saturday it is “extremely unlikely” news hoaxes changed the outcome. Ensnared in a string of content controversies in recent months, Facebook has insisted that it is a technology company, not a media firm. But scrutiny of the site has heightened since the surprise election of Republican Donald Trump on Tuesday, with critics alleging the site helped spread lies via fake news stories and hoaxes.  Zuckerberg has vehemently defended the network against such criticism, calling the idea that Facebook affected the election  “crazy” at a conference on Thursday. He echoed that stance in his late Saturday post, though he said the company would do more to prevent fake news.  Such hoaxes represent a sliver of content shared on Facebook and because they are not limited to partisan views or politics, it is unlikely they could have changed the election’s outcome, Zuckerberg said. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,” he said, noting the network’s goal is to “give every person a voice.” Still, Facebook has launched work to enable people to flag hoaxes and fake news, the statement said. Facebook has faced a number of content controversies this year, including international outcry after it removed an iconic Vietnam War photo due to nudity, a decision that was later reversed. The thorniest content issues are decided by a group of top executives at Facebook. Questions over content policing have returned to the fore in the tense days since the election, which has led to protests against Trump and his proposed policies in major U.S. cities. Ahead of the Nov. 8 election, Facebook users saw fake news reports erroneously alleging that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and that a federal agent who had been investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was found dead. Senior management have launched a conversation to examine Facebook’s involvement in affecting opinions and votes, The New York Times reported on Saturday, saying a group of vice presidents and executives began discussing late Tuesday the company’s role in the election’s outcome.  Facebook’s policy team was called together and the firm plans to address staff concerns at a broader meeting, the paper reported, citing anonymous sources.  Facebook representatives were not immediately available to comment on the report. “After the election, many people are asking whether fake news contributed to the result, and what our responsibility is to prevent fake news from spreading,” Zuckerberg said on Saturday.  “These are very important questions and I care deeply about getting them right.”",politicsNews,"November 13, 2016 ",1

11699,EU executive moves to punish Poland over court reforms,"The EU executive launched an unprecedented process on Wednesday to suspend Poland s voting rights in the European Union after two years of dispute over judicial reforms that Brussels says undermine Polish courts  independence. The European Commission, the guardian of EU law, will now ask the other EU governments to declare that Poland s changes to the judiciary constitute  a clear risk of a serious breach  of EU values   especially the rule of law. However, it gave Warsaw, where a new prime minister took office only this month, three months to remedy the situation and said it could rescind its decision if it did so. Often referred to as the EU s  nuclear option , the move carries the ultimate threat of sanctions but is in fact unlikely to result in that.  The Commission has today concluded that there is a clear risk of a serious breach of the rule of law in Poland,  the Commission said in a statement.  Judicial reforms in Poland mean that the country s judiciary is now under the political control of the ruling majority. In the absence of judicial independence, serious questions are raised about the effective application of EU law.  The Commission s deputy head, First Vice President Frans Timmermans, who has conducted talks with the Polish government dominated by Law and Justice Party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski for the past two years, said he was acting  with a heavy heart  but was obliged to take action to protect the Union as a whole.  We are open for dialogue 24/7,  Timmermans said, saying that if Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who took office just this month, were to change tack, he would be ready to respond. But Timmermans insisted:  As guardians of the treaty, the Commission is under a strict responsibility to act ... If the application of the rule of law is left completely to the individual member states, then the whole of the EU will suffer.    This decision has no merit. It is in our opinion a purely political decision,  Beata Mazurek, a spokeswoman for Poland s ruling party, was quoted as saying by state news agency PAP. Stung by Britain s vote last year to leave the Union, the EU institutions are battling a rise in euroskeptic nationalism across the continent and particularly in the former Communist east, where Poland s ally Hungary has also prompted previously the Commission to threaten sanctions over the rule of law. Seeking to counter Warsaw s accusations of an anti-Polish bias in Brussels and in his own behavior, Timmermans, who once worked in the Soviet bloc as a Dutch diplomat, praised Poland s historic contribution to overcoming the Cold War divide of Europe but said Warsaw now bore a special responsibility to prevent new rifts opening up over democratic principles.  I want to stand by the Polish people in this time which is very difficult for them, and for us,  he said, adding that the defending a separation of powers was of  existential importance not just for the Polish nation but for the EU as a whole . The next step in the process is that EU governments, meeting in the Council of the European Union, will hear Poland out and ask it to address their concerns.  But if 22 out of the EU s 28 countries and the European Parliament are not satisfied in the end, the process will move on to the next stages, which may mean sanctions. The sanctions can involve the suspension of  the rights deriving from the application of the Treaties to the Member State in question, including the voting rights .  This formulation leaves open the possibility also of suspending EU financial transfers to Poland, now the biggest beneficiary of European funds aimed at boosting living standards in the former communist country. Sanctions can be imposed with the backing of a majority of countries representing a majority of the EU s citizens. But to get to that stage, EU governments have first to unanimously agree that what was initially just a risk of a serious breach of the rule of law has now become a reality. This is unlikely to happen, because Hungary has already declared that it would not support such a motion against Poland. But the mere threat of it underlines the sharp deterioration in ties between Warsaw and Brussels since the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party won power in late 2015. The Commission and Council of Europe legal experts, known as the Venice Commission, say Poland s judicial reforms undermine judges  independence because they give the ruling party control over the sacking and the appointments of judges, as well as the option to end the terms of some Supreme Court judges early. The Council of Europe, Europe s human rights watchdog, has compared such measures to those of the Soviet system. The PiS government rejects these accusations, saying the changes are needed because courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist era-mentality.

9134,TRUMP RUFFLES FEATHERS With New And Bold Presidential “Challenge” Coin,"Who knew that members of a presidential administration can have coins made to hand out.  Challenge coins  are given out and received by different people like first responders or the military . President Trump has the challenge coins he has received displayed in the Oval Office.Coin collector John Wertman shows his  very gold  Trump challenge coin:HOW THEY GOT THEIR START:Challenge coins got their start as military baubles bearing division insignia and presented by officers to troops for exemplary service. The moniker came from a tradition in which service members challenged one another to produce their coins. Those who did not have one had to buy a round of drinks.For two decades, the commander in chief has doled out distinguished-looking coins as personal mementos. Now, the presidential  challenge coin  has undergone a Trumpian transformation.The presidential seal has been replaced by an eagle bearing President Trump s signature. The eagle s head faces right, not left, as on the seal. The 13 arrows representing the original states have disappeared. And the national motto,  E pluribus unum    a Latin phrase that means  Out of many, one    is gone.Instead, both sides of the coin feature Trump s official campaign slogan,  Make America Great Again. The aide said the president, whose real estate properties are known for their gilded displays of wealth and status, was personally involved in redesigning the coin. Trump, who also had a hand in creating his famous red campaign hat,  wanted to weigh in on it,  the aide said.  It s beautifully made. FEATHERS RUFFLED: Ethics experts  are all aflutter because President Trump used his political slogan on the coin: For the commander in chief to give a political token with a campaign slogan on it to military officers would violate the important principle of separating the military from politics, as well as diminishing the tradition of the coin. There is also dispute about who pays for the coins. As it turns out, the Republican Party is paying for the coins.Yes, the coin is very gold and big but it is Trump s style. It s interesting to note the coins of Obama and Trump reflect each president.Read more: Boston Globe",politics,"Dec 23, 2017",0

Under the plan, the United Nations refugee agency will work with the United States to set up processing centers in several nearby countries, where migrants would be temporarily out of danger.As it does in other places, the United Nations will determine if the migrants could be eligible for refugee status.

And this sprightly son of country preachers and teachers is on a mission to evangelize maybe-Trumpers like House Speaker Paul Ryan on the Gospel According to Donald   with a sermon on self-preservation. I think [Ryan] needs to recognize, on some of these issues, Trump is where the Republicans are and if you re going to be a Republican leader you should be supportive of that,  Sessions told me during a taping of POLITICO s  Off Message  podcast in his Senate office last week. My advice is to listen and accept the will of the American people, the Republican voters   the Republican Party is the Republican voters,  he added   a pointed reference to Ryan s suggestion that he, and not the presumptive party nominee, represents authentic conservative values.

557,FCC chief plans to ditch U.S. 'net neutrality' rules,"The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission unveiled plans on Tuesday to repeal landmark 2015 rules that prohibited internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content in a move that promises to recast the digital landscape. FCC chief Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January, said the commission will vote at a Dec. 14 meeting on his plan to rescind the so-called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities. The rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content. They were intended to ensure a free and open internet, give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content. The action marks a victory for big internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get and at what price. It represents a setback for Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules. Netflix said Tuesday it opposed the measure to “roll back these core protections.” With three Republican and two Democratic commissioners, the move is all but certain to be approved. Trump, a Republican, expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented, calling it a “power grab” by Obama. The White House did not immediately comment Tuesday. Pai said his proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules because internet service is “inherently an interstate service.” The preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic-governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers’ equal access to internet content. “The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,” Pai said in an interview, adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “heavy-handed” regulation of the internet. “We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses,” Pai added. Tom Wheeler, who headed the FCC under Obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules, called the planned repeal “a shameful sham and sellout. Even for this FCC and its leadership, this proposal raises hypocrisy to new heights.” AT&T, Comcast and Verizon have said that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing. Comcast said no matter what the FCC decided it would “not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.”  Verizon said it believed the FCC “will reinstate a framework that protects consumers’ access to the open internet, without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation.” The Internet Association, representing major technology firms including Alphabet and Facebook, said Pai’s proposal “represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans.” “This proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect Americans’ ability to access the entire internet,” it said. Pai’s proposal would require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so-called internet fast lanes to facilitate a practice called paid prioritization of charging for certain content. Such disclosure will make it easier for another agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers, Pai said. The FTC could seek to bar practices that it deemed “anticompetitive” or violated antitrust rules. The FCC received more than 22 million comments. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed Tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments. A U.S. appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations, which were challenged in a lawsuit led by telecommunications industry trade association US Telecom. The group praised Pai’s decision to remove “antiquated, restrictive regulations” to “pave the way for broadband network investment, expansion and upgrades.” The FCC’s repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality. Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. House of Representatives Democrat, said the FCC move would hurt consumers and chill competition, saying the agency “has launched an all-out assault on the entrepreneurship, innovation and competition at the heart of the internet.” The planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump took office in January. Trump has abandoned international trade deals, the landmark Paris climate accord and environmental protections, taken aim at the Iran nuclear accord and closer relations with Cuba, and sought repeal Obama’s signature healthcare law. Pai, who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since becoming FCC chairman, is pushing a broad deregulatory agenda. Pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the White House in advance or been directed to undo net neutrality by White House officials. The FCC under Obama regulated internet service providers like public utilities under a section of federal law that gave the agency sweeping oversight over the conduct of these companies. Language in the new proposal would give the FCC significantly less authority to oversee the web. The FCC granted initial approval to Pai’s plan in May, but had left open many key questions including whether to retain any legal requirements limiting internet providers conduct. His plan would eliminate the “internet conduct standard,” which gave the FCC far-reaching discretion to prohibit improper internet service provider practices.",politicsNews,"November 21, 2017 ",1
17274,London art auction raises $2.5 million for survivors of deadly Grenfell Tower blaze,"An auction of 31 artworks donated by some of Britain s most successful contemporary artists has raised close to 2 million pounds for survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire that killed about 80 people in June. Home to a close-knit, multi-ethnic community, the 24-storey social housing block was reduced to a charred ruin by the inferno that engulfed it in the middle of the night. Many survivors have yet to be rehoused and are still living in hotels. The charity auction, held at autioneer Sotheby s late on Monday, included works by A-list artists including Wolfgang Tillmans, Antony Gormley, Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas, Mark Wallinger and Rachel Whiteread. The idea came from film producer and art collector Hamish McAlpine and art consultant Katie Heller, who said the emotional impact of the Grenfell tragedy was such that almost all the artists they approached agreed to donate works immediately.  Grenfell touched their souls,  McAlpine told Reuters at Sotheby s before the auction.  It s a very emotive subject for people in London.  The proceeds, which totaled more than 1.925 million pounds  ($2.55 million), will be divided equally among 158 surviving families. They will receive the funds before Christmas. Every single one of the lots on offer sold, making the auction a  White Glove  sale in auctioneers  parlance, Sotheby s said. The amount raised was double the pre-auction estimate. The most expensive lot was  Freischwimmer 193 , a very large green print by the London-based German artist Wolfgang Tillmans, which sold for 392,750 pounds. Next came  Small Charge , a cast iron sculpture by Antony Gormley, which was snapped up for 344,750 pounds. Two of the artworks were especially created for the auction. Tacita Dean s  Lay the Dust With Tears , a gray and black charcoal-on-paper image reminiscent of billowing smoke, sold for 22,500 pounds, while Idris Khan s  I Remember , also a somber image in dark tones made with oil, charcoal and chalk on paper, went for 43,750 pounds.",worldnews,"October 17, 2017 ",0
5093,Trump administration pledges 'great strictness' on Iran nuclear deal,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration pledged on Tuesday to show “great strictness” over restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities imposed by a deal with major powers, but gave little indication of what that might mean for the agreement.   The 2015 deal between Iran and six major powers restricts Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic.  Trump has called the agreement “the worst deal ever negotiated”. His administration is now carrying out a review of the accord which could take months, but it has said little about where it stands on specific issues. The Trump administration also gave few clues about any potential policy shift on Tuesday in a statement to a quarterly meeting of the U.N. nuclear watchdog’s Board of Governors. “The United States will approach questions of JCPOA interpretation, implementation, and enforcement with great strictness indeed,” the statement to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) 35-nation board said, citing the deal’s full name: the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. But the U.S. statement, the first to the Board of Governors since Trump took office in January, also repeated language used by the administration of former U.S. president Barack Obama, for whom the deal was a legacy achievement. “Iran must strictly and fully adhere to all commitments and technical measures for their duration,” it said - wording identical to that used in the U.S. statement to the previous Board of Governors meeting in November. The IAEA, which polices the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities under the deal, last month produced a quarterly report saying that Iran’s stock of enriched uranium had halved after coming close to a limit imposed by the agreement. That report was the first to specify how much enriched uranium Iran has, thanks to a series of agreements between Tehran and major powers clarifying items that would not count toward the stock. Some major powers had criticized previous reports for not being specific enough on items such as the size of the enriched uranium stock, and the U.S. statement called for future reports to be as detailed. “We welcome inclusion of the additional level of detail, and expect it will continue in the future,” it said.",politicsNews,"March 7, 2017 ",1

9565,Illinois lawmakers approve $700 million to pay social services in part,"A bill to send $700 million to cash-starved social services providers breezed through the Illinois Legislature on Thursday, as the state once again turned to stopgap funding measures in lieu of a budget. The measure passed the House 111-0 and the Senate 56-0. There was no immediate comment from Governor Bruce Rauner’s office on whether he will sign it into law. A memo from his budget office expressed concerns that language in the bill could actually prevent funding for some programs. Democratic State Representative Greg Harris said the money would be taken from state funds outside of Illinois’ general revenue fund to cover 46 percent of what the state has failed to pay service providers due to the ongoing impasse over the fiscal 2016 budget. “This is a $700 million piece of legislation that would help the neediest at the time they need help the most,” he said. Despite the stalemate between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature, about 90 percent of Illinois government is being funded through continuing appropriations, the enactment of a K-12 school bill, and court-ordered spending. But some parts of the government were left out in the cold. Earlier this month, dozens of unpaid social service providers sued Illinois, seeking more than $100 million. Andrea Durbin, chairman of the Pay Now Illinois coalition that filed the lawsuit, said that if enacted, the bill would not end the litigation. “It could provide a downpayment of the money we are owed, but it’s not a comprehensive solution for the Pay Now Illinois plaintiffs,” she said. In April, the legislature passed and Rauner signed a $600 million stopgap funding bill for state universities, community colleges, and student tuition grants that covered only 34 percent of the $1.7 billion that had been earmarked for higher education spending in the fiscal year that began on July 1. Illinois is the only U.S. state without a complete fiscal 2016 budget. Rauner earlier on Thursday acknowledged that some lawmakers are working on a budget framework. That framework involves higher taxes, spending cuts, and borrowing, according to local media reports.  “I’m cheering for bipartisan General Assembly members to come up with some solutions,” the governor told reporters.",politicsNews,"May 12, 2016 ",0
17701,Ukraine's controversial law reforms open to revision: Justice Minister,"Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavlo Petrenko said on Thursday he was open to amending law reforms amid concerns they aided corruption and could lead to the end of probes into the shooting of protesters in the run-up up to the 2014 revolution. The eastern European nation, which is in a dispute with Russia over its annexation of Crimea, passed amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code last week that anti-corruption groups say severely limits the time investigators have to solve a crime and present a case in court.  Petrenko said he had yet to go through the final text of the lengthy reforms, but he said that he was aware of the concerns.  If there (are) some positions which make problems for the investigations process for old cases or for new cases I will give proposals to the parliament and president to change these positions,  Petrenko told Reuters in an interview in Sydney, where he was attending a legal industry conference. The legislation still requires the sign-off from President Petro Poroshenko.  The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine said in a statement last week the new legislation could force investigators to present a criminal case before court within six months, or up to 12 months with a court extension. Corrupt officials could benefit, the law enforcement agency said, given the complexity of investigations that can involve international assistance. There are also fears that the legislation could prevent prosecutions for crimes committed during the Euromaidan street demonstrations in 2013 and 2014, where more than 100 protesters, demanding closer European integration, were gunned down. The popular uprising, that focused on corruption concerns and the country s Russian ties, culminated with the removal of the then president Viktor Yanukovych. More than three years on, Ukraine is still dealing with allegations of deep corruption with Transparency International earlier this year ranking it 131st of 176 countries in the World Ranking of Corruption Perception. Petrenko said on Thursday the country was intent on reforming its judicial system, which included the selection of more than 100 Supreme Court judges after a competition-style candidate process designed to root out corruption.     Are all these people ideal? I think no, because the country is not ideal,  Petrenko said.  You cannot find some ideal people from Mars or from the moon and take them and put in these positions, but those people, they went through the objective, transparent and absolutely public competition.

If it is determined that the request to change email addresses was made by someone so closely aligned with the Secretary s IT operation as Mr. Combetta, then it will certainly prompt additional inquiry,  Meadows told The Hill.  The date of the Reddit post in relationship to the establishment of the Select Committee on Benghazi is also troubling. The Reddit message was sent on July 23, 2014, according to an archive of the page saved by other users. The day before, the Benghazi Committee had reached an agreement with the State Department on the production of related records, according the FBI s investigation into Clinton s use of the server.The identity of the  stonetear  user is not confirmed. Reddit users point to the fact that an account on the online marketplace Easy for a Paul Combetta has the username  stonetear  and the inactive website combetta.com is registered to the email address stonetear@gmail.com.Combetta appeared under subpoena in a committee hearing last week on the alleged destruction of evidence, but both he and colleague Bill Thornton exercised their Fifth Amendment right not to testify.borismkv: There is no supported way to do what you re asking. You can only delete emails after they re stored in the database. You can t change them. If there was a feature in Exchange that allowed this, it could result in major legal issues. There may be ways to hack a solution, but I am not aware of any. permalinkembedsavegive goldstonetear: As a PST file or exported MSG files, this could be done though, yes? The issue is that these emails involve the private email address of someone you d recognize, and we re trying to replace it with a placeholder address as to not expose it.exproject: To my knowledge, there s no way to edit existing messages, that s a possibility for a discovery nightmare. To strip/rename on outbound/inbound you could rewrite it with a transport rule.stonetear: That wouldn t work on existing messages though right?odoprasm: Is there no way to access and edb manually?stonetear: I have full access to the server   what are you suggesting with the EDB file?stonetear: I think maybe I wasn t clear enough in the original post. I have these emails available in a PST file. Can I rewrite them in the PST? I could also export to MSG and do some sort of batch find/replace. Anyone know of tools that might help with this?exproject: Just because you have the messages available in multiple formats and locations doesn t change that it s an attribute of the envelope not meant to be rewritten. The functionality is just not built into any tool I know of. Having that functionality would create the ability to screw with discovery (I mean, there could be mitigation with versioning, but that would need other configuration) While it may not be a read-only part of the envelope(I m not actually sure), the only tool that MIGHT be able to do what you want is MFCMapi, and I don t think you want to play with that for this job. The chance of getting it wrong would be pretty high I think and it is not a particularly friendly tool. I m not sure it could be scripted with it either. My recommendation would be what /u/borismkv said. Making a mailbox for VIP and telling them to use that. Forwarding to VIPs mailbox would be ripe for them to just respond directly instead of responding through his relay mailbox. As for your existing messages, if the current users absolutely cannot see the existing messages, you ll need to do a search and export and just forcibly remove the messages from their mailboxes. It s not clean and not advised by me, but if they don t want VIPs address out there it will need to be removed. I would do a search with his email address as the query with -LogOnly -LogLevel Full and see what kind of results you get.EDIT: Holy shit they actually deleted all their comments from a 2 year old reddit post, I think we hit gold on this one.

Mills told investigators Clinton had decided she no longer needed access to emails older than 60 days.But the technician apparently forgot the request and didn t immediately comply. According to the FBI report, between March 25 and March 31 of 2015, the technician  believed he had an  oh shit  moment and   deleted the Clinton archive mailbox from the [Platte River Networks] server. Reporting from The New York Times has since identified Combetta as that technician, citing an anonymous law enforcement official and others familiar with the FBI probe.Clinton and Mills told the FBI that they had no knowledge of the technician s deletion of the emails. The technician, according to the report,  was aware of the existence of the [Benghazi Committee] preservation request and the fact that it meant he should not disturb Clinton s email data on the [Platte River Networks] server.

16671,U.S. coalition denies deadly strike in Syria's Deir al-Zor city,"The U.S.-led coalition on Tuesday denied striking Deir al-Zor city in eastern Syria after Damascus accused its jets of killing more than a dozen people.  Syrian state television had said the U.S.-led coalition hit the government-held Qusur district, killing 14 civilians and wounding 32, on Monday.  The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was unclear which aircraft carried out the raid, but that it killed at least 22 people. Colonel Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, said on Tuesday that its jets had not conducted air strikes on any part of the eastern city. The coalition says it investigates any such allegations and is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and neighboring Iraq.  The Syrian army controls much of Deir al-Zor city, after pushing into it last month with the help of Russian air strikes and Iran-backed militias. That advance broke an Islamic State siege of an enclave there which had lasted nearly three years. Syrian troops and allied forces are now fighting Islamic State militants in a few remaining districts of the city, and in nearby parts of Deir al-Zor province. The U.S.-led coalition has been striking Islamic State targets to back an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias in other parts of the province across the Euphrates river.

6859,"Trump says 'nothing funny' about 'Saturday Night Live,' but audience soars","U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday doubled down on his scorn for satirical TV show “Saturday Night Live,” whose popularity has soared since Alec Baldwin began impersonating him in the final weeks leading up to the election. Trump, a guest host on “Saturday Night Live” in November 2015 when he was running for the Republican presidential nomination, has vented his anger on Twitter in recent weeks, calling the NBC show “totally unwatchable” and a “hit-job.” In an interview on NBC’s “Today” show on Wednesday, Trump was asked whether he had considered no longer watching it, given his complaints. “I hosted ‘SNL’ when it was a good show, but it’s not a good show anymore,” Trump responded. “First of all, nothing to do with me, there’s nothing funny about it. The skits are terrible.” The show’s audience has jumped 33 percent since Baldwin began impersonating Trump in October, according to NBC. The network said some 11.4 million people on average are watching the program this season, starting Oct. 1, making it the most-watched season since 1992. Trump on Wednesday attempted to cast doubt on the future of “Saturday Night Live,” which has lampooned presidents and politicians from both parties since it first aired 41 years ago.  “Frankly, the way the show is going now, if you look at the kind of work they’re doing, who knows how long that show’s going to be on. It’s a terrible show,” Trump said. The Republican businessman and former star of NBC’s reality TV show “The Apprentice” also said Baldwin’s depiction of him was “really mean-spirited and not very good.” “I do like him and I like him as an actor, but I don’t think his imitation of me gets me at all,” Trump added. Baldwin, who has portrayed Trump as unprepared for office or tweeting during security briefings, tweeted back to Trump last week, “Release your tax returns and I’ll stop. Ha.”  Trump broke with decades of tradition followed by both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates by refusing to release his tax returns. Baldwin, 58, the former star of NBC’s comedy “30 Rock,” told celebrity magazine Hola! in an interview, that he was glad other people found his impressions funny after a divisive election. “There are bad feelings on both sides, so to have the opportunity to give people a chance to talk and laugh about it is a good thing,” Baldwin told the U.S. edition of the magazine in an interview released on Tuesday.",politicsNews,"December 7, 2016 ",1

14537,IS MARCO RUBIO The Republican Obama On Immigration?,"Is Marco Rubio the Republican Obama, or has he been unfairly characterized by his opponents in the GOP?  Wednesday s cover of La Opini n, the nation s largest daily Spanish-language newspaper, prominently portrays donor-class favorite Sen. Marco Rubio with the infamous  hope and change  imagery that defined Barack Obama s presidential campaign.The cover of the Spanish-language paper writes:  The Republican Obama? The surge of the Latino Senator in the presidential campaign has made him a target of criticism on the subject of immigration. Marco Rubio and Barack Obama share many of the same policy goals, such as Obamatrade and military intervention in Libya, but their most striking similarities are on the subject of immigration. Both men support citizenship for illegal aliens, expanded refugee resettlement, more green cards, more H-1B visas, and large permanent expansions to the rate of immigration and foreign worker importation.Marco Rubio was the co-author of the 2013 Obama-backed immigration bill. Rubio s immigration bill was endorsed by La Raza, the AFL-CIO, SEIU, Rep. Nancy Pelosi , Rep. Luis Gutierrez , Sen. Harry Reid , Mark Zuckerberg, and George Soros. Rubio has not renounced his support for a single policy item outlined in the Gang of Eight bill including his desire to triple green card issuances, double foreign worker visas, and grant citizenship to illegal immigrants.Rubio has even borrowed much of the language of the Obama s campaign prompting Joe Scarborough to mock the young Senator. Following the Iowa caucus,  Morning Joe  replayed Obama s 2008 acceptance speech celebrating his victory at the Iowa caucus and juxtaposed that with Rubio s strikingly similar Iowa speech celebrating his campaign s ability to inch up to third place. You know, I have said for a year that he is the Republican Obama,  Scarborough said.  He is the Republican Obama and he just stole the speech  In my opinion having somebody with little experience before they become president has not actually been great.  SCARBOROUGH TELLS IT LIKE IT IS: In that sense, Rubio is the  Obama  for Republican donors, but not the Republican Party s actual voters. Indeed, whereas Sen. John McCain lacked the Obama-esque tools to pass mass immigration for the donors in 2007, Rubio was able to bypass conservatism opposition and pass a bill with far more foreign workers through the Senate in 2013 using the affection of conservatives to neutralize opposition to a top donor class priority.Via: Breitbart",politics,"Feb 4, 2016",1

18515,"Capitalism is the only way, UK finance minister says in challenge to Labour","British finance minister Philip Hammond defended capitalism as the only route to prosperity on Monday, in an attempt to counter the opposition Labour Party s increasingly popular vision for a more centrally-controlled economy. In a speech to the ruling Conservative Party that contained only two new policy announcements, Hammond also said that the government s immediate task was to deal with the uncertainty for citizens and businesses resulting from Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May is grappling with deep divisions within her party over how to handle the Brexit talks and serious doubts about her leadership after her botched bet on a June snap election lost the Conservatives their majority in parliament and boosted Labour s hopes of eventually regaining power. Hammond, who was sidelined by May during the election campaign, said last week s Labour Party conference showed it wanted to impose on Britain, the world s fifth largest economy, the  socialist fantasy  seen in Cuba, Venezuela or Zimbabwe.  We saw Labour in the raw, exposed for what it has sadly become: a party taken hostage by a clique of hard-left extremist infiltrators, people who despise Britain s values and talk down our country,  Hammond told Conservative Party activists. Seeking to put the economy center-stage in the Conservatives  pitch to voters, Hammond said Britain could only hope to experience rising living standards  by harnessing the power of the market economy . Last week Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn set out plans for a much more active role for the state in the economy, including renationalization of key infrastructure, higher government spending, and more taxation and control of the banking sector. With opinion polls showing Labour gaining support, Hammond aims to convince voters that Corbyn would make them poorer. Labour s leaders, he said,  openly proclaim their ambition to demolish our successful modern market economy and replace it with a back-to-the-future socialist fantasy with hundreds of billions of extra debt for the next generation to pay.  His words echo those of May, who last week issued her own defense of capitalism - a sign of growing concern about the threat Labour poses to the pro-business orthodoxy that has underpinned British economic policy since Margaret Thatcher s reforms in the 1980s.  Our economy is not broken: It is fundamentally strong,  Hammond said, while also accepting that a lack of progress in talks on Britain s divorce settlement with the European Union and uncertainty over future ties were weighing on businesses.  The process of negotiating our exit from the EU has created uncertainty so investment has slowed as businesses wait for clarity,  Hammond said. Business groups welcomed Hammond s defense of free markets, but said the government needed to do much more.  The speech shows a government strong on diagnosis, but weak on action. Businesses looking for clear vision and urgent delivery have been left with slim pickings,  said Carolyn Fairbairn, head of the Confederation of British Industry. Hammond pledged 400 million pounds ($535 million) of additional road and rail spending and 10 billion pounds of funding to help young Britons get on the property ladder. The government has also announced plans to tackle high levels of student debt and limits on pay for public sector workers.  We must never deny or dismiss the underlying concerns that the election articulated: we must listen to them and we must respond,  Hammond said, adding that the government should offer  pragmatic solutions  to improve ordinary people s lives. But with Brexit on the horizon, a slowing economy and the Bank of England hinting that interest rates could rise, May and Hammond have limited room for fiscal maneuver. The British Chambers of Commerce has warned that public rifts within the cabinet are undermining business confidence. Divisions over Europe helped sink the Conservative premierships of Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron.  Public disagreements between cabinet ministers in recent weeks have only served to undermine business confidence, not just on Brexit negotiations, but also on the many issues where firms need to see clear action from government closer to home,   said the Chambers  director general, Adam Marshall. Last month rating agency Moody s downgraded Britain s credit rating, saying government plans to reduce its debt load had been knocked off course and that Brexit would harm the economy. Labour said Hammond s speech on Monday was disappointing.  After 40 wasted minutes speaking and seven wasted years of Tory economic failure, the country expected to see the Chancellor change course,  Labour s finance policy chief John McDonnell said.  But instead, after a year in the job, he is continuing down the path of his predecessor and clinging to an old economic model that fails the many.

190,"Prayer, principle guide women voters in Roy Moore's Alabama hometown","In a U.S. Senate race rocked by allegations of sexual misconduct against Republican candidate Roy Moore, some women in his hometown said they were sticking by the embattled nominee while others said prayer would guide their votes on Tuesday. Caroll Norman, a retired middle school teacher in Gadsden, said she did not know if she would vote for a Democrat for the first time in her life or write in another name on her ballot. Perusing a candle shop downtown Monday evening, the Trump supporter said not even the president’s vocal backing of the embattled Republican nominee had swayed her. “I’ll have to pray about it and make a decision in the morning,” the 64-year-old Republican said. Reuters spoke to more than a dozen women in the religious, working-class city of about 36,000 people an hour from Birmingham. Gadsden landed in an unwelcome spotlight after multiple women came forward last month to accuse Moore of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was a local prosecutors in his 30s. One accuser said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14. Moore denounced the allegations as political attacks and refused to heed national Republicans’ calls to leave the race. Reuters has not independently confirmed any of the accusations. Norman said there were inconsistencies in the women’s stories, as well as in some of Moore’s responses.  Nearby at a bus stop downtown, where Christmas music played from speakers on light poles, Republican Sara Teet, 35, said she also remained conflicted. “I just don’t know what to believe,” she said. “I don’t know what to do.”  But at the Gadsden Mall, Republican Debbie Handy said she was voting for “the judge,” as many locals refer to Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice.  “I’ve known him a long time and he’d never have anything to do with those women,” Handy, 40, said. “He’s a man of integrity. He’s a strong Christian.” Handy said she also liked Moore because he supports Trump, who last year won 73 percent of the presidential vote in Etowah County, where Gadsden is the county seat. “Trump and Moore will bring America back to what it should be,” she said. Robin Gibson, 61, a store clerk and self-described liberal Democrat, said she knew one of Moore’s accusers and she believed the allegations against him. Her vote on Tuesday for Democrat Doug Jones would have nothing to do with thwarting Trump or trying to erode the slim margin Republicans hold in the Senate, she said. “This isn’t a race about Trump’s plans for our country. It’s about who represents my state,” Gibson said. Around town, where there were noticeably few campaign signs for either candidate, many voters echoed the sentiments of Pat Miller in the final hours of the race. “We’ve had CNN and the Washington Post and some fellas from New York City all over the place,” said Miller, 54, as she walked out of the Gadsden Variety Café with a bowl of hot chili. “All I can say is that we all can’t wait for this to be over.”",politicsNews,"December 12, 2017 ",0
14901,"Strong earthquake hits Iraq and Iran, killing more than 450","Thousands of homeless Iranians huddled against the cold late on Monday, a day after at least 450 people were killed in Iran s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade, state TV said. Rescue teams kept up search operations for dozens trapped beneath the rubble of collapsed houses in towns and villages in the mountainous area of the western province of Kermanshah that borders Iraq.   Iran s English-language Press TV said more than 450 people were killed and 7,000 were injured when the magnitude 7.3 earthquake jolted the country on Sunday. Local officials expected the death toll to climb as search and rescue teams reached remote areas of Iran.  The quake was felt in several provinces of Iran but the hardest hit province was Kermanshah. More than 300 of the victims were in Sarpol-e Zahab county in that province, about 15 km (10 miles) from the Iraq border.  Iranian state television said the quake had caused heavy damage in some villages where houses were made of earthen bricks. The quake also triggered landslides that hindered rescue efforts, officials told state television.  At least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected, Iranian media reported. Iranian media reported that a woman and her baby were pulled out alive from the rubble on Monday in Sarpol-e Zahab, the worst hit area with a population of 85,000. Relief workers said while much aid had been pledged, there was an immediate need for blankets, children s clothes, medicine and large cans to store drinking water. TV aired footage of some people weeping next to corpses shrouded in blankets. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences on Monday, urging all government agencies to do all they could to help those affected. State TV appealed for blood donations. The government announced one day mourning on Tuesday.  Tempers frayed in the quake-hit area as the search went on for survivors amidst the twisted rubble of collapsed buildings. State TV aired footage of damaged buildings, vehicles under rubble and wounded people wrapped in blankets.  We need a shelter,  a middle-aged man in Sarpol-e Zahab told state TV.  Where is the aid? Where is the help?  His family could not spend another night outside in cold weather, he said.     An Iraqi meteorology official put the quake s magnitude at 6.5, with the epicenter in Penjwin in Iraq s Sulaimaniyah province in the Kurdistan region, close to the main border crossing with Iran. Kurdish health officials said at least six people were killed in Iraq and at least 68 injured, adding that in northern Iraq Kurdish districts seven were killed and 325 wounded. Iraq s health and local officials said the worst-hit area was Darbandikham district, near the border with Iran, where at least 10 houses had collapsed and the district s only hospital was severely damaged.  The situation there is very critical,  Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed told Reuters. The district s main hospital was damaged and had no power, Rasheed said, so the injured were taken to Sulaimaniyah for treatment. Homes and buildings had extensive structural damage, he said.  The quake was felt as far south as Baghdad, where many residents rushed from their houses and tall buildings when tremors shook the Iraqi capital.  I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,  said Majida Ameer. who ran out of her building with her three children.   I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming:  Earthquake!  An Iranian local official told state TV that some villages were totally destroyed.   I lost nine members of my family ... they were killed while they slept,  a weeping middle-aged woman told state TV.      Local officials said hundreds of critically wounded people had been transferred to other provinces as Kermanshah s main hospital had been badly damaged.  Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. A magnitude 6.6 quake on Dec. 26, 2003, devastated the historic city of Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran, killing about 31,000 people. Electricity and water was cut off in several Iranian and Iraqi cities, and fears of aftershocks sent thousands of people in both countries out onto the streets and parks in cold weather. Across the area, rescue workers and special teams using sniffer dogs and heat sensors searched wreckage. Blocked roads made it hard for rescue workers to reach some remote villages.  Iranian authorities acknowledged the relief effort was still slow and patchy. More than 70,000 people needed emergency shelter, the head of Iranian Red Crescent said. Hojjat Gharibian, one of hundreds of homeless Iranian survivors, was huddled against the cold with his family in Qasr-e Shirin.   My two children were sleeping when the house started to collapse because of the quake. I took them and ran to the street. We spent hours in the street until aid workers moved us into a school building,  Gharibian told Reuters by telephone.   Iran s police, Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia forces were sent to quake-hit areas overnight, state TV reported. Aid workers handed out water to people, while bulldozers worked to clear the streets in damaged areas.  A local official said aftershocks slowed down erecting tents for homeless people but electricity had been restored in most of the quake-hit areas.    The main problem is sheltering people at this cold weather. We need more tents,  Qasr-e Shririn governor Faramarz Akbari told TV.",worldnews,"November 12, 2017 ",1
8588,Excited About ‘The X-Files’ Reboot? Here’s Something Concerning You Should Know,"While it s exciting to see a great television show finally make its way back to the small screen, it s disappointing to realize another aspect of old school TV was also rebooted. While David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are both equal partners on The X-Files, as it turns out, when Anderson was approached for the reboot she was offered half as much money as her costar. So much for equal pay for equal work. Apparently, having an extra appendage in between your legs makes you somehow more valuable.The characters Mulder (Duchovny) and Scully (Anderson) go together like peanut butter and jelly, peas and carrots, Bert and Ernie. You wouldn t pay Ernie less than Bert, would you? Well, of course not. They re both male, and puppets   we re getting off track.Here s the thing, back in the 90s, when The X-Files was originally airing on television, Anderson worked hard to make sure she was paid equally as much as her costar. When asked about the current pay disparity, Anderson said: I m surprised that more [interviewers] haven t brought that up because it s the truth. Especially in this climate of women talking about the reality of [unequal pay] in this business, I think it s important that it gets heard and voiced. It was shocking to me, given all the work that I had done in the past to get us to be paid fairly. I worked really hard toward that and finally got somewhere with it. Even in interviews in the last few years, people have said to me,  I can t believe that happened, how did you feel about it, that is insane.  And my response always was,  That was then, this is now.  And then it happened again! I don t even know what to say about it. It is  sad. According to the Hollywood Reporter, both Anderson and Duchovny were paid the same in the end, but the fact that they weren t from the get-go is, well, sad, as Anderson said.Unless a show features a strong male lead and other female actresses are quite obviously supporting roles, co-leads, regardless of gender, should be paid the same. They both bring the same amount of talent and equity to their performances and the show s success.This is still a battle not only women in Hollywood have to continually face, but women in every profession nationwide. So, while some conservatives like to tout that  women are already equal    actually, no, they re not  at all. It s important now, more than ever, to make sure we elect into the White House another person with the ideal of making sure equal pay for equal work happens once and for all. It s time. In fact, it s far past time. We need another liberal in the White House.Featured image: YouTube screengrab",News,"January 22, 2016",0
17534,Factbox: U.S. congressional leaders on Iran nuclear deal,"U.S. President Donald Trump will strike a blow against the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement on Friday in defiance of other world powers, choosing not to certify that Tehran is complying with the deal in a major reversal of U.S. policy. Trump s decision will not withdraw the United States from the agreement, which was negotiated by Washington and other world powers during the administration of former President Barack Obama. The move likely gives U.S. lawmakers 60 days to decide whether to bring back sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the deal.   If Congress reimposes the sanctions, the United States would in effect be in violation of the terms of the nuclear deal and it would likely fall apart. If lawmakers do nothing, the deal remains in place. Here is a look at where key U.S. lawmakers stand on the deal:  SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL: Like every Republican in Congress, McConnell voted against the Iran nuclear agreement. He has not expressed a position on how he will respond to Trump s decertification, but has not yet broken from Trump on policy matters. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SPEAKER PAUL RYAN: Has not said where he stands.  I don t want to get ahead of the president,  he said last week. HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY: Has not said what he would do. SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN BOB CORKER: Repeatedly spoke out against the agreement and wrote legislation that gave Congress some say over it. While he has questioned Trump recently on some foreign policy issues - helping spark a Twitter feud - Corker has followed the administration line on most policy matters. Corker said on Friday he expected to introduce legislation to  address flaws  in the pact without violating it.  HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN ED ROYCE: Royce says  As flawed as the deal is, I believe we must now enforce the hell out of it.  It was not clear how he would respond to the legislation.  SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER: Opposed the deal two years ago but more recently says it should be left in place but strongly enforced with efforts to clamp down on other activities like Iran s ballistic missile program. HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI: Supported the original deal, still supports it. SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE TOP DEMOCRAT BEN CARDIN: Opposed the deal two years ago, but says U.S. should honor it now, while strictly enforcing it and clamping down on other Iranian activities detrimental to the interests of the United States and its allies. HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS TOP DEMOCRAT ELLIOT ENGEL: Opposed the deal two years ago but said killing it now would be a  grave mistake.  Still an Iran hawk on issues such as Tehran s ballistic missile program, human rights violations and its support for what Washington sees as terrorism.",worldnews,"October 13, 2017 ",0
690,Bush Ethics Lawyer Slams Trump: He Can’t Go ‘One Week’ Without Obstructing Justice [VIDEO],"Richard Painter, former ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush, claims that President Donald Trump  weighing in  on his son, Donald Trump Jr. s, statement on meeting with a Russian lawyer is yet another possible example of obstruction of justice by the U.S. Commander in Chief. Painter even went as far as to say that obstruction of justice is a weekly occurrence for the Trump administration. I would like to have one week from this White House where they don t engage in a new act of obstruction of justice,  Painter said during an interview on MSNBC s All In With Chris Hayes on Tuesday evening.Painter also added that if Trump Jr. has no problem using a false statement drafted by his father when dealing with the public, then he would probably have the same disregard for the truth while taking the stand to testify on the situation during a criminal investigation. Once the son says something in a public statement he d be very likely to say something to the special prosecutor, and lying to the special prosecutor is a crime. If he lies under oath it becomes perjury,  Painter said.  This is a common strategy for obstructing justice. But that wasn t the first time Richard Painter made his opinions about the President s method of dealing with the Russia accusations known. In fact, Painter had taken to Twitter earlier that morning to attack Trump on his favorite platform.Knowingly drafting a false statement for a person who is a witness in a criminal investigation is itself a crime.

8013,Asian viewers give nod to Clinton after first presidential debate,"Hillary Clinton put Donald Trump on the defensive and showed a better grasp of foreign policy issues, according to a sampling of people across Asia who watched the fiery first U.S. presidential debate.     In China, the debate was streamed live on China’s Twitter-like Weibo service and attracted thousands of comments despite the lack of a translation into Chinese.  Some called Trump “a loose cannon”, while others thought that as a businessman he was best qualified to lead the world’s largest economy.  William Hua, a Chinese lawyer who watched the debate at an American Chamber of Commerce event in Beijing, said he thought Clinton came out on top. He was most concerned, though, about an issue that didn’t come up in the debate. “Donald Trump says Japan and South Korea can develop nuclear weapons? It seems absolutely ridiculous,” Hua said.  Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in March he would consider letting Japan and South Korea build their own nuclear weapons, rather than rely on America for protection against North Korea.  Opinion polls have shown the two candidates in a tight race leading up to the debate. A CNN poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62 percent felt Clinton won compared to 27 percent for Trump.   In a sign investors also saw Clinton as the winner, U.S. S&P500 stock futures rose as did Asian shares. “Markets started to call the debate for Hillary within the first 15 minutes or so, with the Mexican peso surging in what is probably its busiest Asian session in years,” said Sean Callow, a senior currency analyst at Westpac in Sydney.  The Mexican currency has risen and fallen in recent weeks depending on polling numbers for Trump, who has vowed to take trade protectionist measure against the United States’ southern neighbor and build a wall across the U.S. border with Mexico to prevent illegal immigration. Trump raised eyebrows among a packed crowd watching the debate at The American Club in Singapore when he lashed out against China.  “Look at what China is doing to our country,” Trump said not long after the debate began. “They are devaluing their currency and we have nobody in our government to fight them ... They are using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.” Landy Eng, a former employee of the California state government who’s been living in Singapore the past 20 years, said he was an undecided voter. “But Trump’s China-bashing is something I’m not particularly in favor of,” he said.  Still, Eng said he does like the  “disruptive” factor of Trump’s campaign and thinks it is making Clinton a better candidate. Aloysius Lee, a 65-year-old retiree from Hong Kong, who watched the debate at The Foreign Correspondents’ Club in the territory, said that Trump was too unpredictable.  “Hillary is the kind of person you can do business with, at least from my point of view,” Lee said. With Trump, “you don’t know what’s going to happen next, you don’t know what he’s going to say next”. South Koreans, watching the debate on TV screens in the lobby of Seoul’s central train station, said they were with Clinton on the issues.  “Trump has ideas of withdrawing U.S. forces from our country, and in terms of national security, Trump is a threatening figure,” said Lee Hyo-jin, 26. “So I support Hillary,” she said. Trump during the debate again said if U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea “don’t pay their fair share, they may have to defend themselves or help us out.” Asked about Trump’s comment, Japan’s Defence Minister Tomomi Inada told a regularly scheduled news conference on Tuesday the U.S.-Japan military alliance does not just benefit Japan “but is also in the interests of the United States.”  Clinton seemed to have the better temperament during the debate, according to some Asian viewers.  Li Jiaoli, 21, an editing intern from China’s southwestern province of Sichuan, said Clinton seemed more presidential while Trump’s expressions made her laugh.  “Trump’s responses were too aggressive. High-level politicians should have more self-control,” Li said. The debate prompted a storm of tweets around the region, many of them commenting on the optics of the debate. “Trump is looking worked up and angry and sulky and shouty -She looks utterly in control by contrast,” said Barkha Dutt, news anchor on India’s NDTV in a tweet. “She ignores his barbs & attacks; he gets baited by every one of hers.”  Mel Fryer, 30, a waitress at the Mercantile Hotel in Sydney’s historic Rocks district said she was “terrified” at the prospect of a Trump presidency, while the debate screened to an empty pub. “But he’s going ok,” she said of his debate performance. “He uses simple words and simple phrases and gets his point across.”",politicsNews,"September 27, 2016 ",0
18666,ISLAMIC JUSTICE: Britain Is Stunned When They Discover How Many Secret Sharia Courts Are Operating In UK,"Like dominoes, the Hijra keeps marching across Europe, destroying the distinct cultures of one country after another. Sweden and the UK are in big trouble France is next and thanks to bleeding heart liberal Democrats in America, the U.S. isn t be far behind At least 85 Islamic sharia courts are operating in Britain, a study claimed yesterday.The astonishing figure is 17 times higher than previously accepted.The tribunals, working mainly from mosques, settle financial and family disputes according to religious principles. They lay down judgments which can be given full legal status if approved in national law courts.However, they operate behind doors that are closed to independent observers and their decisions are likely to be unfair to women and backed by intimidation, a report by independent think-tank Civitas said.Commentators on the influence of sharia law often count only the five courts in London, Manchester, Bradford, Birmingham and Nuneaton that are run by the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal, a body whose rulings are enforced through the state courts under the 1996 Arbitration Act.But the study by academic and Islamic specialist Denis MacEoin estimates there are at least 85 working tribunals.The spread of sharia law has become increasingly controversial since its role was backed last year by Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams and Lord Phillips, the Lord Chief Justice who stepped down last October.Dr Williams said a recognised role for sharia law seemed  unavoidable  and Lord Phillips said there was no reason why decisions made on sharia principles should not be recognised by the national courts.But the Civitas report said the principles on which sharia courts work are indicated by the fatwas   religious decrees   set out on websites run by British mosques.Mr MacEoin said:  Among the rulings we find some that advise illegal actions and others that transgress human rights standards as applied by British courts. Examples set out in his study include a ruling that no Muslim woman may marry a non-Muslim man unless he converts to Islam and that any children of a woman who does should be taken from her until she marries a Muslim.Further rulings, according to the report, approve polygamous marriage and enforce a woman s duty to have sex with her husband on his demand.The report added:  The fact that so many sharia rulings in Britain relate to cases concerning divorce and custody of children is of particular concern, as women are not equal in sharia law, and sharia contains no specific commitment to the best interests of the child that is fundamental to family law in the UK. Under sharia, a male child belongs to the father after the age of seven, regardless of circumstances. It said:  Sharia courts operating in Britain may be handing down rulings that are inappropriate to this country because they are linked to elements in Islamic law that are seriously out of step with trends in Western legislation. WATCH Muslims demand Shari Law in Britain:The Civitas study said the Islamic courts should no longer be recognised under British law.Its director Dr David Green said:  The reality is that for many Muslims, sharia courts are in practice part of an institutionalised atmosphere of intimidation, backed by the ultimate sanction of a death threat. Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said:  Everyone should be deeply concerned about the extent of these courts. They do entrench division in society, and do nothing to entrench integration or community cohesion. It leads to a segregated society. There should be one law, and that should be British law. We can t have a situation where people can choose which system of law they follow and which they do not. We can t have a situation where people choose the system of law which they feel gives them the best outcome. Everyone should equal under one law.

16154,Philippines police chief hints at possible run for presidency,"The Philippines  top police chief who oversaw a bloody war on drugs that has killed thousands of Filipinos hinted on Monday at a possible run for the presidency. Ronald dela Rosa, a stocky, celebrity-like general nicknamed  Bato  (Rock), who retires in 2018, has flagged his political ambitions, saying he was open to running for the Senate. But in a speech after a flag raising ceremony at police headquarters, Dela Rosa for the first time publicly suggested he may have his sights set on higher political goals.  Wait for Bato to become president and I will quadruple your salaries,  Dela Rosa told his men as he denied rumors he would leave retirees out of planned salary increases. Dela Rosa is among those touted by the national media as Duterte s possible successor in 2022, along with world boxing champion and senator Manny Pacquiao, and the son and namesake of late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos.  Dela Rosa has acted as the enforcer for the firebrand leader s war on drugs which had led to more than 3,900 people killed in 16 months. The campaign has sparked outrage abroad, but domestic polls have shown crime-weary Filipinos are largely supportive of the measure.  Duterte ordered the police this month to halt activities in the war on drugs and leave all operations to drug enforcement agency, amid unprecedented scrutiny of police conduct. Police reject allegations by activists they are executing suspected drug users and dealers, saying victims in their anti-narcotics operations were killed because they were armed and had violently resisted arrest.",worldnews,"October 30, 2017 ",0
19989,YOUR BLOOD WILL BOIL When You See Why College Students Were Forced To Stand Guard Over Thousands Of U.S. FLAGS Meant To Honor 9-11 Victims On Their Liberal Campus,"This is how coddled kids who have never had to deal with losing an innocent family member, friend or co-worker at the hands of evil Islamic terrorists behaves At Occidental College on Saturday, vandals trashed 2,977 U.S. flags planted in the quad to memorialize those who died on Sept. 11.The students who planted the small American flags found them uprooted and thrown in campus garbage cans. Every last flag. Some were even snapped in half.Not only that, dozens of makeshift fliers accompanied the vandalism. Taped to benches and other surfaces, most of the fliers stated  R.I.P.  to 9/11 victims as well as to 1.45 million Iraqis who died  during the U.S. invasion for something they didn t do. Sophomore Alan Bliss, a math and economics major who helped lead the effort to plant the flags, told The College Fix in a telephone interview Sunday that when he and a friend came across the destroyed memorial, three students confronted him and said they found the display  triggering.  He said the students also accused him of white privilege and ignorance.Occidental is a small liberal-arts college in Los Angeles known as far-left. President Barack Obama attended for two years before transferring to Columbia. So when the right or even moderates try to do something on campus there is extreme push back,  Bliss said of his school, adding conservatives are a  silent majority  there and some students are even scared of speaking up against progressives for fear of retribution.As for the display, Bliss said it was installed Saturday afternoon by his conservative student club, which is affiliated with the College Republican National Committee and Young Americans for Freedom, the latter of which helped sponsor the  Never Forget  memorial project.Later that night Bliss said he learned bandits had uprooted and tossed the flags. When Bliss and his friend arrived at the scene, it was 12:30 a.m. Sunday morning. The three students who told Bliss the display is triggering denied involvement in the vandalism, he said.Campus safety was called and officers took statements from Bliss as well as the other three students.Meanwhile, Bliss added, as word spread on social media that the  Never Forget  memorial was razed, students left their dorm rooms in the middle of the night to help replant the flags. As students came home from parties, they chipped in, too. They were just like,  I am not Republican, I am not conservative, but this is a terrible act,  Bliss said.  They stayed there late into the night, 2 a.m., planting flags. It was pretty amazing, it was pretty touching. A Facebook post from the club offers more details on the long evening:  Later that morning, a few of us stood guard at the memorial. Four Occidental students came up and snapped a few flags right in our faces. When we confronted them, those cowards got away as fast as they possibly could. When Bliss (pictured) and his friends returned to the display after breakfast Sunday morning, he said he found another 100 flags trashed. And again, Bliss and his peers replanted.Bliss, 20, co-founder and president of the club, which he alanblisslaunched in the spring of 2016, said he plans to fight back.

19586,Belarus plays down Western fears of aggression stirred by joint war games with Russia,"Belarus said on Wednesday the West had no reason to fear attack by its close ally Russia or that Moscow could leave behind forces after war games it is holding with Minsk for a possible occupation of Western neighbors. Russia has repeatedly said the exercises, code named  Zapad  or  West  which began on Sept. 14, are purely defensive in nature and do not target a third country or group of countries. NATO has voiced concern that Moscow could use the war games as a cover to station troops and equipment in Belarus. The U.S.-led alliance has said the drills lack transparency and the number of troops taking part could be much larger than the 12,700 servicemen declared by Moscow and Minsk. Russia s neighbors have said they fear Moscow could use the exercises as a rehearsal for an occupation of adjacent nations like Poland, Ukraine or the three Baltic republics - all of which were under Moscow s rule before the Communist Soviet Union broke up in 1991. Poland and the Baltics are now members of NATO and the European Union, while Ukraine is pursuing such ties.  The attempt to discredit the exercises is extremely unprofessional,  said Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko.  We won t wage war on anyone. Do not expect any attack from us - especially on Ukraine,  he told reporters at a firing range  75 km (47 miles) east of Belarus s capital Minsk after overseeing the last day of Zapad maneuvers.  All the troops will be back to the sites of their permanent deployment,  he said, dressed in camouflage uniform as supreme commander.  In a week, this issue will become irrelevant.  On an overcast and rainy day, he watched from a vantage point as allied troops of Russia and Belarus repelled a simulated attack by forces of three fictitious neighboring nations on Belarus. Aircraft zeroed in on ground targets after mock dogfighting, after which a ground offensive unfolded. Hours earlier, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskait  made the exercises the centerpiece of her annual speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.  Even as we speak, around 100,000 Russian troops are engaged in offensive military exercise  Zapad 2017  on the borders of the Baltic States, Poland and even in the Arctic,  she said.  The Kremlin is rehearsing aggressive scenarios against its neighbors, training its army to attack the West. The exercise is also part of information warfare aimed at spreading uncertainty and fear.  The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had provided exhaustive information on the exercises before they were held to the military attaches of all interested countries and allowed their observers to attend the event to allay any concerns.   I think that upon receiving this information Ms. Grybauskaite will have a chance to change her point of view,  President Vladimir Putin s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.    Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo also voiced disquiet at the exercises and said Warsaw opposed any lifting of Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Ukraine s Crimea region and role in its separatist conflict.  We are very concerned by what is happening in Belarus, from the exercises there,  Szydlo said during a visit to Bulgaria.",worldnews,"September 20, 2017 ",1

But Trump said on Tuesday he likely will not attend the debate. This will be the last one before the Iowa caucuses on Monday marking the first contest in the nomination race for the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Trump has been engaged in a public spat with Fox News that began at a debate last August in which he said he was subject to unfair questioning by moderator Megyn Kelly.  “Let’s see how much money Fox makes without me in the debate,” Trump told the news conference in Marshalltown, Iowa. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who failed to qualify for the main event in the last debate, made the cut this time. The other participants in the 9 p.m. EST debate will be Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich.

291,"Factbox: Corporate alternative minimum tax threat hits pharma, tech","The tax overhaul legislation passed by the U.S. Senate jettisoned a long-held Republican goal of repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT), a move seen as hurting companies that invest heavily in research and development. The Senate’s inclusion of the AMT puts the bill, passed narrowly last Saturday, on a collision course with Republicans in the House of Representatives, whose version would repeal the corporate AMT. House Republicans are calling for the tax to be eliminated in final legislation to be hammered out by a House-Senate conference committee. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said on Wednesday a final tax bill that congressional Republicans hope to get to President Donald Trump for his signature by the Dec. 25 Christmas holiday likely will not retain the AMT. Here are some details on the impact of the AMT and which companies and industries invest the most in R&D. — The 20 percent corporate AMT is an alternative to the regular corporate income tax in computing taxes owed, designed to limit the benefit of deductions and tax credits, including credits for R&D that are popular with Silicon Valley. — With the top corporate rate now at 35 percent, few wind up paying the AMT. But since congressional Republicans want to cut the tax rate to 20 percent, the AMT could affect many companies.  — “Retaining the AMT in reform is even more harmful than it is in its present form,” the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobby group said on its website. “This cannot be the intended impact from a Congress who has worked for years to enact a more globally competitive tax code.” — Companies in the U.S. pharmaceutical and medical research industry plowed about 17 percent of total revenue into R&D in their most recent fiscal year, according to Thomson Reuters data. — The software industry and IT services invested 14 percent of revenue in R&D while technology and equipment companies invested 12 percent of their revenue in R&D. — The healthcare services and equipment sector spent 5.6 percent of its revenue on R&D in the most recent fiscal year. — Manufacturers also invest significantly in R&D, with Boeing (BA.N) investing 5 percent of its revenue in R&D last year. — “Research and development is the lifeblood of manufacturing. The NAM supports pro-growth tax reform, and is working with key policymakers to ensure the final bill does not inadvertently harm manufacturing,” said Chris Netram, vice president for tax and domestic economic policy at the National Association of Manufacturers lobby group.",politicsNews,"December 6, 2017 ",0

5233,Mike Pence Somehow Makes Trump’s Khan Family Disaster EVEN WORSE (TWEET),"Ever since Khizr and Ghazala Khan gave their powerful speech at Hillary Clinton s Democratic National Convention, Trump has been attacking them for calling him out on his anti-Muslim rhetoric.The Khans are the parents of a slain Muslim soldier who was killed while fighting for America   but that didn t stop Trump from insulting and disrespecting them. Trump not only criticized Mrs. Khan for not speaking during the speech (which was really because the grieving Gold Star mother was afraid she would burst into tears) and telling the Khans that he, too, had made so many sacrifices.TwitterSince these remarks, Trump has received backlash from both Democrats and Republicans who recognize how heartless and cowardly it is to attack the parents of a slain soldier. Hillary Clinton herself denounced Trump s criticism of Ghazala, calling Trump s attacks insulting the family of a fallen soldier   Captain Khan, an American Muslim who sacrificed his life to protect his unit and other soldiers as a taxi raced toward a base containing a bomb. If you didn t think the response from Trump could get any worse, you re severely underestimating him and his team. On Sunday night, Trump s running mate released a statement that first appeared to be a defense of the Khan family   until the true nature of his statement was revealed. Mike Pence, in a Facebook post, claimed that even though Trump s recent actions show that he does NOT care at all about the Kahns, Trump actually cares very much. Pence, whose own son is a Marine, wrote, Captain Khan gave his life to defend our country in the global war on terror. Then of course, Pence goes on to blame President Barack Obama and Clinton for ISIS   and doubled down on Trump s proposal to ban Muslims from coming into the United States. Pence wrote: By suspending immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism, rebuilding our military, defeating ISIS at its source and projecting strength on the global stage, we will reduce the likelihood that other American families will face the enduring heartbreak of the Khan family.

He said another organization would be set up to promote the Muslim-friendly presidential candidate.Awad urged all Muslims to register to vote and to use Islamic centers as polling stations.

5109,WATCH: Gun Nut Believes Trump’s ‘Second Amendment’ Threat Is A Call To Arms,"Donald Trump s  Second Amendment  threat just took a more frightening turn.National outrage ensued after the Republican nominee suggested on Tuesday that gun owners do something to stop Hillary Clinton from nominating judges to the Supreme Court. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,  Trump said.  Although the Second Amendment people   maybe there is, I don t know. This statement prompted the Secret Service to take the unprecedented step of responding to an assassination threat by a presidential candidate against an opposing candidate, whom the Secret Service is charged with protecting and would be in the line of fire should a right-wing gun nut answer Trump s dog whistle.And it appears that at least one gun nut is interpreting Trump s dog whistle call as a call for armed insurrection if Hillary Clinton becomes president and doesn t pick who they want her to pick as a Supreme Court Justice.Greg from Michigan called into C-SPAN on Wednesday morning and while he denied that Trump was calling for Hillary to be shot and killed he frighteningly declared that Trump was actually calling for a bloody armed revolt if conservatives don t get their way. Number one, Mr. Trump was not threatening assassination of Hillary. But what he was implying and could happen is if Hillary got her way and did do away with Second Amendment rights, there are a lot of us who are gun owners who are going to object to that very strongly. And since we do have firearms, it might if it comes down to it be us having to defend our rights with those guns, just as the revolutionaries did in the Revolutionary War. Here s the video via C-SPAN:Trump s rhetoric just took a scary turn and his supporters are taking him seriously. Republicans have talked about  Second Amendment remedies  before but American voters have been consistent in rejecting candidates who spew such rhetoric. The idea of using guns to force your political agenda on the country is a threat to our democracy and has no place in this country. It s time for voters to once again reject this rhetoric by defeating Trump by a landslide. Republicans need to learn once and for all that threats of gun violence is not a political strategy and is a sure way to lose elections.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"August 10, 2016",0

9529,'The Wire' actor Pierce arrested after scuffle over Democratic politics,"Actor Wendell Pierce, who starred in HBO’s “The Wire,” was arrested in Atlanta over the weekend and charged with battery after an altercation sparked by differences in opinion about the U.S. presidential race, police said on Monday. The incident occurred early Saturday morning after Pierce, a Hillary Clinton backer, got into a political debate with a couple at the Loews Atlanta Hotel, according to an Atlanta Police Department arrest report. Media reports said the couple supported Clinton rival Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination. The police report said Pierce followed the couple through the hotel and tried to force his way into their room, and also that he pulled the woman’s hoodie off and hit her in the head. Pierce denied the allegations, police said, and no one needed medical attention. Pierce’s representatives could not be reached for comment.

3942,Trump nominee for China ambassador promises firm line on Beijing,"President Donald Trump’s nominee for ambassador to China promised on Tuesday to take a firm line with Beijing on issues from North Korea to trade disputes and human rights, and seemed poised for an easy confirmation by the U.S. Senate. Iowa Governor Terry Branstad said he would use his decades of experience with China to press Beijing to do more to encourage North Korea to curb its nuclear ambitions. “There’s other things they can do diplomatically and economically to send a clear signal that they, as well as the United States and other countries in the world, do not tolerate this expansion of nuclear technology and missiles,” Branstad said at his confirmation hearing. Pressed, Branstad said “there may well be” a role for measures such as imposing secondary sanctions on Chinese banks or other entities that violated U.N. Security Council resolutions by doing business with North Korea. He offered few specifics. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated that China was serious about enforcing U.N. resolutions and, referring to the possibility of secondary U.S. sanctions, said China opposed other countries using their law to sanction others or to harm Chinese interests. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called Branstad, 70, an “old friend” after decades of dealings on agricultural trade. But the Republican governor insisted he would take on difficult issues complicating Washington’s relationship with its largest trading partner and major creditor. That would contrast with Trump’s recent warm words for Xi, which have caused some U.S. allies to wonder if Trump’s focus on working with China on North Korea means Washington may not still have their backs. “The fact that the leader of China calls us an old friend, doesn’t mean that I’m going to be at all reluctant or bashful of bringing up issues ... be it human rights or intellectual property rights,” Branstad told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Committee members expressed few concerns about Branstad, signaling he likely will be confirmed easily. They had tough words for China. Senator Bob Corker, the panel’s Republican chairman, blasted China’s actions in the South China Sea, and “cyber theft of intellectual property.” He warned against focusing on short-term goals at the expense of long-term U.S. interests. “There’s no country in the world that we have so many issues with,” Corker said. Branstad took a hard line on the South China Sea, saying, “China cannot be allowed to use its artificial islands to coerce its neighbors or limit freedom of navigation or overflight.” Trump has taken an “America First” approach to trade.

8538,House Speaker Ryan: No point in lame duck vote on TPP deal,"U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that he saw no point in bringing up the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal for a vote in any “lame duck” session of Congress later this year after November elections, because “we don’t have the votes.” “As long as we don’t have the votes, I see no point in bringing up an agreement only to defeat it,” Ryan, a Republican, said in an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio.  Despite both U.S. presidential candidates bashing the 12-country Pacific trade deal on the campaign trail, Obama administration officials have pledged to make a major push in coming months to persuade the Republican-majority Congress to pass TPP.  Backed by dozens of business and industry groups, officials  from the U.S. Commerce Department, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office and the White House say they are continuing to talk with individual lawmakers about the merits of the deal, including its consequences for U.S. leadership in Asia.  But Ryan said the Obama administration had negotiated a deal that “cost them dozens of votes in Congress,” and said the Democratic president needed to renegotiate some components. The speaker said some agricultural and labor provisions needed fixing, and he also believed the deal would reduce intellectual property rights for biologic drugs and pharmaceuticals. For U.S. drugmakers the deal could reduce the patent protection period to eight years from the current 12. Senator Orrin Hatch, the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has also raised this as a major problem with the deal. “They have to fix this agreement and renegotiate some pieces of it if they have any hope or chance of passing it,” Ryan said in the radio interview, but added that he was doubtful this could happen. “I don’t see how they’ll ever get the votes for it.”",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 ",0

1727,Republican unity on U.S. tax overhaul shows sign of fraying,"Republican efforts to unite the White House, Senate and House of Representatives behind a single tax reform plan appeared to be unraveling on Thursday, when one of the “Big Six” negotiators said the group would not dictate tax policy in the Senate.    At the outset of a congressional hearing on tax reform, Senator Orrin Hatch said the Senate Finance Committee he chairs would not be a rubber stamp for the other congressional Republican leaders and senior aides to President Donald Trump who make up the select group that has been working on a tax reform framework for months. The Big Six is preparing to release its framework on Sept. 25, a release that will sound the starting gun for Hatch’s panel and the House Ways and Means Committee to produce tax reform legislation that is now expected in October. Overhauling the U.S. tax code is a top priority of Trump and congressional Republicans, who campaigned on it last year. They have made little progress since taking power in Washington in January via a closed-door process that has excluded Democrats. “The group – some have deemed us the Big Six – will not dictate the direction we take in this committee,” Hatch said. “The Finance Committee will not be bound by any previous tax reform proposal or framework when we start putting our bill together.” Some analysts viewed the Utah Republican’s comments as the beginning of what could be a widening rift among Republicans in the Senate, House and White House that could jeopardize hopes of completing the first overhaul of the tax code in 31 years before January. “Disagreements over both substance and process are driving a wedge between senior House Republicans involved in the tax-writing process and their Senate counterparts,” Henrietta Treyz of investment advisory firm Veda Partners said in a report.  But House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, Hatch’s congressional counterpart, described potential divergence as a natural and even healthy development that would be kept in check by common ground on major tax issues. “We’ll work this out by the end of the year,” Brady told reporters. “At the end of the day, we just have to sit down and find common ground.” Hatch and Brady are among the Big Six, which also includes Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn. There have already been two statements of general tax principles from Republicans: a one-page document from the Trump administration in April and a joint statement from the Big Six negotiators in July. Democrats have criticized Republican plans as too favorable to the wealthiest Americans and corporations. With the latest blueprint due in less than two weeks, Brady and Mnuchin appeared to differ on Thursday over how much detail the document would contain. Brady told a policy forum that he did not expect the document to offer specifics on tax rates, while Mnuchin said the plan would contain extensive details including a specific corporate rate. Brady later told reporters that talks continued over what the document would contain.     “It is still clearly possible that tax reform could be enacted over the next near. However, the signs are not particularly positive at the moment,” analyst Jan Hatzius of investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a research note on Thursday. After months of talks, basic questions on the Republican tax plan remain unanswered, such as whether or not the tax cuts they want will expand the U.S. budget deficit. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday that the tax reform plan would be revenue neutral, if economic growth spurred by the legislation is taken into account. Revenue neutrality is fast emerging as a divisive issue in Congress, where deficit hawks have expressed misgivings about adding to the deficit.  In White House meetings with top Democrats in recent days, Trump has shown a new willingness to deal with the opposition.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi talked about tax reform with Trump after their Wednesday discussion on immigration, according to Representative Richard Neal, the top Ways and Means Democrat. Neal said the White House appeared to be “in synch” with Democrats for now on tax relief for the middle class. “I think that there could be some room there for conversation,” he told the same policy forum where Brady spoke.",politicsNews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
8505,Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm,"scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots. A vaccine is not expected to be ready for widespread use for at least two or three years. U.S. government researchers said they started their first clinical trial of a Zika vaccine. How dangerous is it? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said now that the causal relationship has been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years. According to the World Health Organization, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. In addition, the agency said it could cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. Conclusive proof of the damage caused by Zika may take months or years. Brazil reports the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly at more than 1,700 as doctors and Brazilian health officials find that some suspected cases of microcephaly are not the disorder. Suspected ones under investigation had declined to 3,257. Brazil registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus from February until April 2. Current research in Brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue. What are the symptoms of Zika infection?     People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. The symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito. How can Zika be contained? Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries where they may be exposed to Zika. How widespread is the outbreak? Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 54 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected. (1.usa.gov/1ovAJyh) Africa (1): Cape Verde  Americas (45): Anguilla, Antigua, Argentina, Aruba, Barbados, Barbuda, Belize, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaçao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saba, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelmy, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Eustatius, St. Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Cacos, U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela. Oceania/Pacific Islands (8): American Samoa, Fiji, Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga.  What is the history of the Zika virus? The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO.  Can Zika be transmitted through sexual contact? The World Health Organization (WHO) said sexual transmission is “relatively common” and has advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus. It also  advised women living in areas where the virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant. The U.S. CDC is investigating about a dozen cases of possible sexual transmission. Those cases involved possible transmission of the virus from men to their sex partners. But the CDC issued updated recommendations for preventing and testing for Zika infection on July 25, warning that the virus can be transmitted through unprotected sex with an infected female partner. A reported case of female-to-male sexual transmission in New York City, and limited human and non-human primate data indicating that Zika virus RNA can be detected in vaginal secretions, led to the new warning, the agency said. CDC’s expanded warnings on sexual exposure to Zika now  caution against sex without a condom or other barrier method of protection with any person, male or female, who has traveled to or lives in an area with Zika, including female to female transmission with a pregnant partner. British health officials reported Zika was found in a man’s semen two months after he was infected, suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade. The PAHO said Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism. There is no evidence Zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk. The WHO has identified Zika cases in Argentina, Chile, France, Italy and New Zealand as likely caused by sexual transmission.  What other complications are associated with Zika? Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue.",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 ",1
6336,Mexico will 'immediately' respond to any U.S. border tax: minister,"Mexico must be ready to respond immediately with its own tax measures if the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump imposes a border tax, the economy minister said on Friday, warning such protectionism may trigger a global recession.  Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has promised a “major border tax” on companies that shift jobs outside the United States, and such a measure could hobble Mexico’s exports to its top trading partner. “It is clear we need to be prepared to immediately neutralize the impact of such a measure,” Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in an interview on Mexican television.  “And it is very clear how - take a fiscal action that clearly neutralizes it,” he said.  Trump has repeatedly attacked Mexico over trade, jobs and immigration since he first launched his run for the White House in 2015, driving the peso currency to historic lows and unnerving investors, especially in the auto sector.  Guajardo said Trump’s proposed tax “was a problem for the entire world” and that it “would have a wave of impacts that could take us into a global recession.”  Nonetheless, the minister said he expected foreign direct investment in Mexico this year to total around $25 billion, with investment in the energy and telecommunications sectors expected to more than make up for the loss of a planned $1.6 billion Ford Motor Co. (F.N) factory that the company said this month it is cancelling. Trump had strongly criticized the plan, but Ford said its decision was not the result of pressure from Trump. Guajardo also praised the government of Japan and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) for their “reasonable” response to Trump’s threat to impose a significant border tax if the company does not stop making its Corolla model in Mexico for the U.S. market. Toyota said last week the automaker has no immediate plans to curb production in Mexico.  “Toyota has 10 plants in the United States... and employs more than 130,000 Americans. If I were Mr. Trump, I’d treat them with more respect,” Guajardo said. He added that he expects total foreign direct investment during the six-year term of President Enrique Pena Nieto, which ends in late 2018, to average $30 billion annually. Guajardo has previously warned that U.S. corporate tax cuts proposed by Trump, as well as the border tax, could undermine foreign investment in Latin America’s No. 2 economy.

2468,Trump urged Washington to stop bank mergers in 2004 letter,"President Donald Trump warned the administration of George W. Bush in 2004 that big U.S. bank mergers were “totally out of control” and should be stopped as they were forcing businesses to borrow money from foreigners, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Though it is 13 years old, the unsolicited letter from Trump, when he was a New York real estate developer and businessman, to then-Treasury Secretary John Snow sheds some light on Trump’s attitudes toward big banks, which he has alternately lambasted and embraced since becoming a politician. As recently as May, Trump said he was looking at breaking up big banks, echoing a campaign theme from 2016. But as president, Trump has also promised to roll back bank regulations, and he has hired Goldman Sachs veterans as close advisers. In the February 2004 letter to Snow, Trump urged the Bush administration to block a historic merger between Wall Street giants JPMorgan Chase and Bank One. Unveiled a month before Trump wrote to Snow, the deal was completed in July 2004. Trump also asked Snow to stop a merger then under way between Bank of America and FleetBoston Financial. It was completed in April 2004, a few months after the Trump letter, which Reuters obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request and which has not been previously reported. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The letter shows that as a businessman and a reality TV celebrity, Trump was worried about bank combinations and businesses relying on foreign lenders. “Hopefully, you can do something about this very serious situation - which has gotten totally out of control,” Trump wrote. “If this present trend continues, there will literally be one bank left in New York and, perhaps, the country.” “This merger activity has made it almost impossible to deal with these institutions ... and is pushing a tremendous amount of business to foreign banks and lenders,” he wrote. A financial disclosure statement released last month showed that Trump owed at least $130 million to a U.S. unit of Germany’s Deutsche Bank, a sizable share of his total debts of at least $315 million as of mid-2017. Trump has not released his complete income tax returns, which would give a clearer view of his debts to foreign lenders. Amid a public debate on whether the president could be influenced by his debts to foreigners, Trump’s lawyers said in May he does not owe money to Russian lenders. JPMorgan and Bank of America declined to comment. Snow also declined to comment. The United States had about 9,000 federally insured banks in 2004. That number was down by about half from 1984, due in part to aggressive buyout activity. By 2017, the number of U.S. banks was down further, to about 6,000, while the share of assets managed by smaller community banks had fallen to 13 percent from 38 percent in 1984.        Before becoming president, Trump had a contentious relationship with commercial banks after a slump in his casino business. In 1990 he owed a combined $4 billion to scores of banks, according to a lawyer whose team led negotiations between Trump and 72 banks to restructure Trump’s loans.  The Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991 and some of Trump’s lenders vowed never to work with him again after failing to recover 100 percent of what they were owed.  But by 2004, Trump was back on the upswing. His television show “The Apprentice” premiered the month before he sent the letter to Snow. In a hand-written postscript to the letter, Trump wrote: “P.S. I MET YOUR SON IN FLORIDA - HE IS GREAT.”",politicsNews,"July 27, 2017 ",1

2385,Muhammad Ali’s Son Detained At Airport Because His Name Sounds Too Muslim,"Immigration officials in Florida proved how out of control things are in Trump s America by detaining the son of Muhammad Ali because his name happens to sound too Muslim for their liking.Muhammad Ali Jr. and his mother, Khalilah Camacho-Ali, were on their way home after speaking at a Black History Month event in Montego Bay, Jamaica. On Feb. 7, they flew into Fort Lauderdale, Florida. And then things took a disturbing turn.Chris Mancini, a lawyer and friend of the family says they were pulled to the side as they were going through customs. Khalilah Camacho-Ali was released when she pulled out a photo of her with the legendary boxer, but Muhammad Ali Jr. didn t have such a photo. Apparently, being related to a famous person would have meant more to officials than the fact that he s an American citizen with a U.S. passport to prove it.Ali Jr. was held by immigration officials and questioned for almost two hours. Where did you get your name from?  they asked him over and over. When they asked him if he was a Muslim, he said yes, and that really set off alarm bells for officials. They continued to question him about his religion and repeatedly asked him where he was born. Just for the record, he was born in Philadelphia in 1971.USA Today reports:While Ali Jr. was detained, Camacho-Ali ran around the airport asking,  Where s my son?  and begging for help, according to Mancini. Because incidents involving customs officials are considered to be on federal soil, local police had no jurisdiction to help her. Ali Jr. was eventually released two hours later, and the family contacted Mancini the following day.They have both traveled all over the world and never, ever, have they been subjected to this kind of treatment, said Mancini.  To the Ali family, it s crystal clear that this is directly linked to Mr. Trump s efforts to ban Muslims from the United States,  he added. Imagine walking into an airport and being asked about your religion,  he said.  This is classic customs profiling. According to Mancini, the Ali family is debating whether or not to file a federal lawsuit and are searching for others who have been subjected to this kind of racial profiling and harassment.Featured image via Andrew H.

The third formal session since the process began in June, it is due to wind up on Thursday.  We must start negotiating seriously,  Barnier said.  The sooner we remove the ambiguity, the sooner we will be in a position to discuss the future relationship.  He welcomed a series of proposals London made over the summer break, but made clear they fell short of what EU leaders want to see before they will agree to open negotiations on the future free trade agreement the British government wants. Impatient with the structure of talks agreed among the 27 other states and now binding Barnier s negotiators, the British position papers made frequent reference to a future relationship with the EU rather than just the immediate task of bringing legal clarity for people and business when Britain leaves.  The UK government has published a large number of papers covering important issues related to our withdrawal and our vision for a deep and special partnership,  Davis said.  We want to lock in the points where we agree, unpick the areas where we disagree and make further progress on the whole range of issues,  he added. To do that would require  flexibility and imagination from both sides , he said. But the EU wants to settle the major separation issues of ensuring expatriate rights, agreeing a divorce bill and squaring the circle of the future Irish border before jumping into talks about post-Brexit ties with London.  The EU 27 and the European Parliament are united. They will not accept that separation issues are not addressed properly,  Barnier said.  I am ready to intensify negotiations over the coming weeks in order to advance.  British officials took a relaxed view of Barnier s implied criticisms, noting it was a familiar line from the former French minister, and dismissed a suggestion talks were going badly. The EU has already signaled that the slow progress so far has made talks about a new accord with Britain less likely to start after an EU summit in October, as had been hoped. The EU and Britain seem far apart on agreeing how much London should pay the bloc on departure to account for previous commitments.  The Irish issue is extremely delicate because of the history of political violence there, as well as the complex economic consequences of Brexit.  Dublin said on Monday much of the future border arrangements between Northern Ireland and Ireland could be solved before Brexit talks enter the next phase. Neither side expects major breakthroughs this week in talks aimed at unraveling more than 40 years of union. Neither seems ready for major political concessions at this stage. An EU official said it was  clearly worrying that we have major differences of core issues ... with very little time to land all this, even if Britain moves . Britain s opposition Labour Party on Sunday offered an alternative to the policy pursued by Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May by saying it would stay in the European single market for a transitional period after Brexit. The British and German chambers of commerce together urged negotiators on Monday to start talks about future trading relations, and particularly customs arrangements, swiftly. Writing in Le Monde in his native France, Barnier said the EU and Britain must remain allies for their common defense:  The Union of 27 and the United Kingdom will have to join forces to stand up to common threats,  he said.   The security of our citizens cannot be haggled over.",worldnews,"August 27, 2017 ",1
23,CNN CALLS IT: A Democrat Will Represent Alabama In The Senate For The First Time In 25 Years,"Alabama is a notoriously deep red state. It s a place where Democrats always think that we have zero chances of winning   especially in statewide federal elections. However, that is just what happened on Tuesday night in the Special Election to replace Senator Jeff Sessions. Doug Jones, the Democratic Senate candidate who is known in the state for prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan members who bombed a church during the Civil Rights Movement and killed four little African American girls, will be the next Senator from Alabama. CNN has just called the race, as there seems no more GOP-leaning counties out there.To contrast, Roy Moore had been twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court as Chief Justice for violating the law, and was also credibly accused of being a sexual predator toward teen girls. Despite all of that, though, the race was a nail biter, because Moore has a long history and a deep base in Alabama. Of course, decent people   including Republicans   were horrified at the idea of a man like Roy Moore going to the Senate. Despite the allegations of sexual predation, Moore also had said many incendiary things, such as putting forth the idea that Muslims shouldn t be allowed in Congress, that homosexuality should be illegal, and that America was great when slavery was legal. And that s just for starters, too.Thank you Alabama, for letting sanity prevail in this race. Oh, and a message to Democrats   this is proof we can compete everywhere. Get a fifty state strategy going so we can blow the GOP outta the water in 2018.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"December 12, 2017",0
3595,U.S. lawmakers gear up to block Trump plan to slash oil stockpile,"A Trump administration plan to sell off half the U.S. emergency crude oil stockpile to help balance the budget faces opposition in Congress, with lawmakers from both parties worried the proposal would undermine the drilling industry and make the country vulnerable to supply shocks.  The White House’s 2018 budget proposal, sent to Congress on Tuesday, proposes raising nearly $16.6 billion by 2027 by gradually selling millions of barrels from the reserve, which now holds about 688 million barrels of oil in underground caverns in Texas and Louisiana. News of the proposal had briefly sent oil prices tumbling on concern it would oversupply the market, but prices recovered and finished slightly higher on hopes that OPEC and other countries would extend supply cuts.     “We should not be selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve now,” said Senator John Hoeven, a Republican from North Dakota, a leading oil producer state. “We should use the SPR for emergencies, and selling now would disrupt the markets.” The SPR sell-off plan is part of a broader White House proposal to balance the U.S. budget that is meant as starting point to debate policy with Congress - which will ultimately pass its own version.  Whether the SPR proposal will survive the budget process could depend in part on Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a member of the appropriations committee and the head of the chamber’s energy panel. In 2015, when Congress was considering selling a modest amount of oil from the reserve to help fund a transportation bill, Murkowski opposed the idea, saying the reserve should not be used as an ATM.  Murkowski did not directly address the SPR plan in a statement on Tuesday, but she said “a President’s budget is more of a vision than anything else.” Efforts to reach Murkowski on Tuesday were not successful.     Murkowski’s Democratic counterpart on the energy panel, however, raised concerns that liquidating half of the reserve would run counter to the original purpose of the facility, which Congress created in 1975 to protect against global oil disruptions that could harm the U.S. economy.      “We are not going to let Donald Trump auction off our energy security to the highest bidder,” Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington said in an email. The Arab oil embargo of the early 1970s led to chaos at U.S. filling stations and fears of long-term damage to the economy. Much has changed since then: U.S. oil production has surged in recent years and supply from Canada has increased, displacing a large portion of the imports from some less stable Middle Eastern suppliers. U.S. oil imports from the producer group OPEC have fallen to less than 3.2 million bpd in 2016 from more than 5.4 million barrels per day in 2008, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Richard Newell, a former head of the EIA, noted that the plan could cause the United States to break its obligation as a member of the International Energy Agency to hold 90 days’ worth of oil imports on reserve. Currently, the SPR holds about 145 days’ worth of oil imports.    “There are a number of possible scenarios under which reducing the SPR to the levels proposed would violate our IEA treaty obligations,” he said.  Lawmakers from both parties also said releasing oil from the SPR could dampen crude prices and hurt drilling companies still recovering from a price crash in 2014. Trump had campaigned on a promise to revive the drilling industry. “Putting that much oil on the market, you will see a lot of layoffs in the energy business,” said Representative Gene Green, a Democrat from Texas.  Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget told reporters on Tuesday, however, there are ways to tap the SPR slowly and “telegraph it over the course of time” to avoid having a dramatic impact on prices.  Representative Pete Olson, a Texas Republican, said the SPR infrastructure needs improvement because tanks and other equipment are constantly exposed to corrosive salt air. But he did not rush to embrace a sell-off of oil, saying that the larger budget deserves careful scrutiny. Some oil industry representatives also came out against the proposal. Randall Luthi, President of the National Ocean Industries Association said the plan to cut the SPR in half threatened national security. He added he also opposed a proposal in the budget to cut federal oil royalty payments to U.S. Gulf Coast states - funds meant to help them defend their coasts from hurricane damage.",politicsNews,"May 23, 2017 ",1

17415,"HILLARY CLINTON: We All Know She’s Deceitful And Dishonest, But I Bet You Didn’t Know This…","She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer. She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality. I ve decided to reprint a piece of work I did nearly five years ago, because it seems very relevant today given Hillary Clinton s performance in the Benghazi hearings. Back in 2008 when she was running for president, I interviewed two erstwhile staff members of the House Judiciary Committee who were involved with the atergate investigation when Hillary was a low-level staffer there. I interviewed one Democrat staffer and one Republican staffer, and wrote two pieces based on what they told me about Hillary s conduct at the time.I published these pieces back in 2008 for North Star Writers Group, the syndicate I ran at the time. This was the most widely read piece we ever had at NSWG, but because NSWG never gained the high-profile status of the major syndicates, this piece still didn t reach as many people as I thought it deserved to. Today, given the much broader reach of CainTV and yet another incidence of Hillary s arrogance in dealing with a congressional committee, I think it deserves another airing. For the purposes of simplicity, I ve combined the two pieces into one very long one. If you re interested in understanding the true character of Hillary Clinton, it s worth your time to read it.As Hillary Clinton came under increasing scrutiny for her story about facing sniper fire in Bosnia, one question that arose was whether she has engaged in a pattern of lying.The now-retired general counsel and chief of staff of the House Judiciary Committee, who supervised Hillary when she worked on the Watergate investigation, says Hillary s history of lies and unethical behavior goes back farther   and goes much deeper   than anyone realizes.Jerry Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, supervised the work of 27-year-old Hillary Rodham on the committee. Hillary got a job working on the investigation at the behest of her former law professor, Burke Marshall, who was also Sen. Ted Kennedy s chief counsel in the Chappaquiddick affair. When the investigation was over, Zeifman fired Hillary from the committee staff and refused to give her a letter of recommendation   one of only three people who earned that dubious distinction in Zeifman s 17-year career.Why? Because she was a liar,  Zeifman said in an interview last week.  She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer. She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality. How could a 27-year-old House staff member do all that? She couldn t do it by herself, but Zeifman said she was one of several individuals   including Marshall, special counsel John Doar and senior associate special counsel (and future Clinton White House Counsel) Bernard Nussbaum   who engaged in a seemingly implausible scheme to deny Richard Nixon the right to counsel during the investigatioWhy would they want to do that? Because, according to Zeifman, they feared putting Watergate break-in mastermind E. Howard Hunt on the stand to be cross-examined by counsel to the president. Hunt, Zeifman said, had the goods on nefarious activities in the Kennedy Administration that would have made Watergate look like a day at the beach   including Kennedy s purported complicity in the attempted assassination of Fidel Castro.The actions of Hillary and her cohorts went directly against the judgment of top Democrats, up to and including then-House Majority Leader Tip O Neill, that Nixon clearly had the right to counsel. Zeifman says that Hillary, along with Marshall, Nussbaum and Doar, was determined to gain enough votes on the Judiciary Committee to change House rules and deny counsel to Nixon. And in order to pull this off, Zeifman says Hillary wrote a fraudulent legal brief, and confiscated public documents to hide her deception.The brief involved precedent for representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding. When Hillary endeavored to write a legal brief arguing there is no right to representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding, Zeifman says, he told Hillary about the case of Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who faced an impeachment attempt in 1970. As soon as the impeachment resolutions were introduced by (then-House Minority Leader Gerald) Ford, and they were referred to the House Judiciary Committee, the first thing Douglas did was hire himself a lawyer,  Zeifman said.The Judiciary Committee allowed Douglas to keep counsel, thus establishing the precedent. Zeifman says he told Hillary that all the documents establishing this fact were in the Judiciary Committee s public files. So what did Hillary do? Hillary then removed all the Douglas files to the offices where she was located, which at that time was secured and inaccessible to the public,  Zeifman said. Hillary then proceeded to write a legal brief arguing there was no precedent for the right to representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding   as if the Douglas case had never occurred.The brief was so fraudulent and ridiculous, Zeifman believes Hillary would have been disbarred if she had submitted it to a judge.Zeifman says that if Hillary, Marshall, Nussbaum and Doar had succeeded, members of the House Judiciary Committee would have also been denied the right to cross-examine witnesses, and denied the opportunity to even participate in the drafting of articles of impeachment against Nixon.Of course, Nixon s resignation rendered the entire issue moot, ending Hillary s career on the Judiciary Committee staff in a most undistinguished manner. Zeifman says he was urged by top committee members to keep a diary of everything that was happening. He did so, and still has the diary if anyone wants to check the veracity of his story. Certainly, he could not have known in 1974 that diary entries about a young lawyer named Hillary Rodham would be of interest to anyone 34 years later.But they show that the pattern of lies, deceit, fabrications and unethical behavior was established long ago   long before the Bosnia lie, and indeed, even before cattle futures, Travelgate and Whitewater   for the woman who is still asking us to make her president of the United States.Franklin Polk, who served at the time as chief Republican counsel on the committee, confirmed many of these details in two interviews he granted me this past Friday, although his analysis of events is not always identical to Zeifman s. Polk specifically confirmed that Hillary wrote the memo in question, and confirmed that Hillary ignored the Douglas case. (He said he couldn t confirm or dispel the part about Hillary taking the Douglas files.)To Polk, Hillary s memo was dishonest in the sense that she tried to pretend the Douglas precedent didn t exist. But unlike Zeifman, Polk considered the memo dishonest in a way that was more stupid than sinister. Hillary should have mentioned that (the Douglas case), and then tried to argue whether that was a change of policy or not instead of just ignoring it and taking the precedent out of the opinion,  Polk said.Polk recalled that the attempt to deny counsel to Nixon upset a great many members of the committee, including just about all the Republicans, but many Democrats as well. The argument sort of broke like a firestorm on the committee, and I remember Congressman Don Edwards was very upset,  Polk said.  He was the chairman of the subcommittee on constitutional rights. But in truth, the impeachment precedents are not clear. Let s put it this way. In the old days, from the beginning of the country through the 1800s and early 1900s, there were precedents that the target or accused did not have the right to counsel. That s why Polk believes Hillary s approach in writing the memorandum was foolish. He says she could have argued that the Douglas case was an isolated example, and that other historical precedents could apply.But Zeifman says the memo and removal of the Douglas files was only part the effort by Hillary, Doar, Nussbaum and Marshall to pursue their own agenda during the investigation.After my first column, some readers wrote in claiming Zeifman was motivated by jealousy because he was not appointed as the chief counsel in the investigation, with that title going to Doar instead.Zeifman s account is that he supported the appointment of Doar because he, Zeifman, a) did not want the public notoriety that would come with such a high-profile role; and b) didn t have much prosecutorial experience. When he started to have a problem with Doar and his allies was when Zeifman and others, including House Majority Leader Tip O Neill and Democratic committee member Jack Brooks of Texas, began to perceive Doar s group as acting outside the directives and knowledge of the committee and its chairman, Peter Rodino.(O Neill died in 1994. Brooks is still living and I tried unsuccessfully to reach him. I d still like to.)This culminated in a project to research past presidential abuses of power, which committee members felt was crucial in aiding the decisions they would make in deciding how to handle Nixon s alleged offenses.According to Zeifman and other documents, Doar directed Hillary to work with a group of Yale law professors on this project. But the report they generated was never given to the committee. Zeifman believes the reason was that the report was little more than a whitewash of the Kennedy years   a part of the Burke Marshall-led agenda of avoiding revelations during the Watergate investigation that would have embarrassed the Kennedys.The fact that the report was kept under wraps upset Republican committee member Charles Wiggins of California, who wrote a memo to his colleagues on the committee that read in part:Within the past few days, some disturbing information has come to my attention. It is requested that the facts concerning the matter be investigated and a report be made to the full committee as it concerns us all.Early last spring when it became obvious that the committee was considering presidential  abuse of power  as a possible ground of impeachment, I raised the question before the full committee that research should be undertaken so as to furnish a standard against which to test the alleged abusive conduct of Richard Nixon.As I recall, several other members joined with me in this request. I recall as well repeating this request from time to time during the course of our investigation. The staff, as I recall, was noncommittal, but it is certain that no such staff study was made available to the members at any time for their use.Wiggins believed the report was purposely hidden from committee members. Chairman Rodino denied this, and said the reason Hillary s report was not given to committee members was that it contained no value. It s worth noting, of course, that the staff member who made this judgment was John Doar.In a four-page reply to Wiggins, Rodino wrote in part:Hillary Rodham of the impeachment inquiry staff coordinated the work. . . . After the staff received the report it was reviewed by Ms. Rodham, briefly by Mr. Labovitz and Mr. Sack, and by Doar. The staff did not think the manuscript was useful in its present form. . . .In your letter you suggest that members of the staff may have intentionally suppressed the report during the course of its investigation. That was not the case.As a matter of fact, Mr. Doar was more concerned that any highlight of the project might prejudice the case against President Nixon. The fact is that the staff did not think the material was usable by the committee in its existing form and had not had time to modify it so it would have practical utility for the members of the committee. I was informed and agreed with the judgment.Mr. Labovitz, by the way, was John Labovitz, another member of the Democratic staff. I spoke with Labovitz this past Friday as well, and he is no fan of Jerry Zeifman. If it s according to Zeifman, it s inaccurate from my perspective,  Labovitz said. He bases that statement on a recollection that Zeifman did not actually work on the impeachment inquiry staff, although that is contradicted not only by Zeifman but Polk as well.Labovitz said he has no knowledge of Hillary having taken any files, and defended her no-right-to-counsel memo on the grounds that, if she was assigned to write a memo arguing a point of view, she was merely following orders.But as both Zeifman and Polk point out, that doesn t mean ignoring background of which you are aware, or worse, as Zeifman alleges, confiscating documents that disprove your argument.All told, Polk recalls the actions of Hillary, Doar and Nussbaum as more amateurish than anything else. Of course the Republicans went nuts,  Polk said.  But so did some of the Democrats   some of the most liberal Democrats. It was more like these guys   Doar and company   were trying to manage the members of Congress, and it was like,  Who s in charge here?  If you want to convict a president, you want to give him all the rights possible. If you re going to give him a trial, for him to say,  My rights were denied,    it was a stupid effort by people who were just politically tone deaf. So this was a big deal to people in the proceedings on the committee, no question about it. And Jerry Zeifman went nuts, and rightfully so. But my reaction wasn t so much that it was underhanded as it was just stupid. Polk recalls Zeifman sharing with him at the time that he believed Hillary s primary role was to report back to Burke Marshall any time the investigation was taking a turn that was not to the liking of the Kennedys. Jerry used to give the chapter and verse as to how Hillary was the mole into the committee works as to how things were going,  Polk said.  And she d be feeding information back to Burke Marshall, who, at least according to Jerry, was talking to the Kennedys. And when something was off track in the view of the Kennedys, Burke Marshall would call John Doar or something, and there would be a reconsideration of what they were talking about. Jerry used to tell me that this was Hillary s primary function. Zeifman says he had another staff member get him Hillary s phone records, which showed that she was calling Burke Marshall at least once a day, and often several times a day.A final note about all this: I wrote my first column on this subject because, in the aftermath of Hillary being caught in her Bosnia fib, I came in contact with Jerry Zeifman and found his story compelling. Zeifman has been trying to tell his story for many years, and the mainstream media have ignored him. I thought it deserved an airing as a demonstration of how early in her career Hillary began engaging in self-serving, disingenuous conduct.Disingenuously arguing a position? Vanishing documents? Selling out members of her own party to advance a personal agenda? Classic Hillary. Neither my first column on the subject nor this one were designed to show that Hillary is dishonest. I don t really think that s in dispute. Rather, they were designed to show that she has been this way for a very long time   a fact worth considering for anyone contemplating voting for her for president of the United States.By the way, there s something else that started a long time ago. She would go around saying,  I m dating a person who will some day be president,  Polk said.  It was like a Babe Ruth call. And because of that comment she made, I watched Bill Clinton s political efforts as governor of Arkansas, and I never counted him out because she had made that forecast. Bill knew what he wanted a long time ago. Clearly, so did Hillary, and her tactics for trying to achieve it were established even in those early days.Vote wisely.Via: Patriot Net Daily",Government News,"Apr 15, 2015",1

17424,Outgoing leader's protege set to win Kyrgyz presidential election,"A protege of outgoing pro-Russian leader Almazbek Atambayev looked set for a surprise outright victory in Kyrgyzstan s presidential election on Sunday, despite polls having predicted a close runoff between him and an opposition leader. According to preliminary data published by the central election commission, former prime minister and Atambayev ally Sooronbai Jeenbekov had secured 54.22 percent of the vote based on a count from 97 percent of the polling stations. His main opponent, oil tycoon Omurbek Babanov, trailed well behind with 33.47 percent, according to the same early data. A close ally of Moscow and host to a Russian military base, Kyrgyzstan helps its former Soviet overlord project power across a region where China and the United States also vie for influence. In contrast to other Central Asian states, which are mostly run by autocrats, Kyrgyzstan is a boisterous democracy that produces sometimes chaotic changes of leadership.  After its first two presidents were ousted by riots, the country restyled itself as a parliamentary republic where presidential powers are mostly limited to foreign policy and security matters. But Atambayev strengthened executive powers last year. Constitutionally barred from seeking a second six-year term, he backed Jeenbekov, 58, an experienced apparatchik who served as prime minister until August. In Sunday s election, observers, citing pre-election polls, saw none of the candidates clearing the 50 percent threshold for outright victory, with Jeenbekov and Babanov then competing in a runoff. Babanov s campaign office declined to comment on the preliminary results but said it would do so on Monday. Babanov s next move will be closely watched because allegations of electoral fraud were among the main factors behind violent protests which toppled two Kyrgyz presidents in 2005 and 2010. Atambayev - likely to remain a powerful figure if his preferred candidate Jeenbekov does win - warned on Sunday he would use any violence as an opportunity to  cleanse  the country. Atambayev and Jeenbekov s Social Democratic party is the biggest in parliament and dominates the coalition cabinet. But they faced stiff opposition from Babanov, 47, whose Respublika-Ata Zhurt (Fatherland) party has the second-biggest parliamentary faction and whose poll numbers had suggested he and Jeenbekov would compete in a tight runoff. Babanov, also a former prime minister, has accused the government of abusing its powers to ensure Jeenbekov s victory after the authorities charged some of his campaign supporters with plotting a coup and planning to bribe voters. Babanov has denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the charges against his supporters as dirty election tactics. Atambayev and his cabinet have also accused Kazakhstan, a bigger and wealthier neighbor, of backing Babanov - which both Babanov and the Kazakh government deny.  What they (the authorities) are doing is outrageous,  Babanov told reporters on Sunday, adding some of his campaign staff and a reporter for a TV station owned by Babanov had been attacked by unidentified men on the day of the vote. Atambayev on Sunday warned opponents against trying to stage violent protests after the vote.  In fact, if there is unrest, it s going to be a good thing, I would like to cleanse (the country of) them all completely,  he told reporters after casting his ballot. Both Jeenbekov and Babanov have said they consider Russia - where hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz migrant laborers work - a strategic partner. According to preliminary data, voter turnout was 55.93 percent.",worldnews,"October 14, 2017 ",0

20382,Factbox: Norway's close-fought election for parliament,"Norwegians vote on Sept. 10 and 11 to pick a parliament for the next four years and determine whether the center-right minority government stays in power or is replaced by parties on the center-left. Opinion polls show the election remains too close to call. Exit polls and forecasts based on early votes will be made public on Monday at 1900 GMT, and most ballots will be counted within three to four hours. In the case of an exceptionally tight race however, the final result may not emerge until late on Tuesday. Below is a summary of key policy differences and the dynamics of the race: All 169 seats in parliament are up for grabs, and as many as nine parties are expected to win seats under Norway s system of proportional representation. However, there are only two candidates for the job of prime minister - the incumbent Erna Solberg of the Conservatives and Labour s Jonas Gahr Stoere. A calculation by www.pollofpolls.no, measuring the average of September opinion polls, gave Solberg s four-party block 85 seats, just enough for a majority, while the four on the center-left, plus the independent Green Party, would win 84 seats. But whether it s the center-left or center-right that hits the crucial 85 seats, the winner faces tricky post-election negotiations and will meet tough demands from small parties to keep their support over the next four years. The race could be decided by how many of the small parties clear the key four-percent hurdle that gives access to a pool of so-called  seats at large , boosting their presence in parliament. Two parties on the right, two on the left and one in the center, the Greens, are all close to this key threshold. Solberg seeks further cuts in personal income tax and a reduction of the wealth tax, but has declined to say by how much. She requires backing from the centrist Liberals and Christian Democrats, which would temper the size of any cuts. Labour has vowed to raise taxes for above-average earners and the wealthy by up to $2 billion to improve public services and reduce the reliance on cash from Norway s sovereign wealth fund. Citing concerns over climate change and potential pollution, several small parties seek to limit the expansion of Norway s oil and gas industry, which brings in almost half the country s export revenues. The independent Greens, which could hold the balance of power in post-election maneuvers, have made it a condition for anyone seeking their support to end all exploration   a demand that neither Labour nor the Conservatives are willing to meet. Meanwhile, the Liberal Party hopes to slow down the awards of new exploration acreage to oil firms if the Conservatives stay in power, while on the left the Reds and the Socialist Left will make similar demands of a Labour-led government. The seas surrounding the arctic Lofoten archipelago could thus remain off-limits to the oil industry, while the extent of drilling in the far-north Barents Sea may emerge as a flash-point in post-election negotiations. With nearly $1 trillion saved up from Norway s extensive oil and gas industry, the next parliament faces key questions over how to organize the fund and whether to allow investments beyond the foreign stocks, bonds and real estate it currently holds. Decisions are mostly made in consensus between the bigger parties, however, and neither Labour nor the Conservatives have said whether they agree with a recent report that suggested it should no longer be managed by the central bank. If Labour s Gahr Stoere emerges as the likely next prime minister, he will face pressure from center-left parties to review EU-outsider Norway s extensive inclusion in the European Union s single market. At stake is Norway s participation in the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty, strongly favored by both Labour and the Conservatives but opposed by the euro-skeptic Centre Party (CP) and the Socialist Left (SL). However, both the CP and the SL, in government with Labour from 2005 to 2013, agreed at the time to govern on the basis of the EEA.

338,"Trump Regrets, Move Over: ‘Sassy Gay Republican’ Is All Of The Healthcare Angst We Need Right Now","Unless you ve been living under a rock since January, you know that Republicans across the country have been slowly but slowly waking up to the horror that is their giant November mistake. In tale after tale, unfortunate conservatives, once defiant in their hatred of all things left of Hannity, are beginning to see what dyed-in-the-wool Republican policy looks like, and it ain t pretty.But with the disgusting Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill just around the corner and racing toward its September 30th finish line, Trumpcare is everything that MAGA-wearing troglodytes feared: They are just finding out that their diabetes will no longer be covered, their kid s heroin addiction is an afterthought, and their ailin  mama s Medicare is fixin  to be plowed over.Those folks I actually feel kind of bad for. I mean, not really. Most of them voted Trump because they hate Mexicans and gay people. But at least they have the decency to be sick over how nasty it s going to be to get sick under Trumpcare.The ones I have no sympathy for are the self-proclaimed  intellectuals  in the conservative realm. Like one  Sassy Gay Republican  on Twitter. His name is Alex, and if you visit his Twitter right now, it s a bit of a mess, because he s busy soaking in the fame and glory that comes with a BuzzFeed interview and someone calling you  the next Tomi Lahren  (which I don t think Alex has really thought through).But Bill Armagh felt kinda bad for Sassy Alex when he saw that he d been involved in a terrible car accident.

Go on, Sassy:But then Sassy hits a snag in the pantyhose of life, and is forced to re-think some things:That can t be good. If only there was a way you could be covered in situations like this. Hmm And even Billy was surprised to find out there was more to the story of the Sassy Gay Republican. It turns out his conservative friends didn t have as much sympathy for him as he thought they might in his time of need:And it looks like Sassy himself may be having some serious second thoughts about how well conservative policies serve his interests:Welcome to the club, Sassy Gay Republican. It s terrifying in here.Note: I have not included a link for Alex s GoFundMe page, because there is some question as to whether the picture may be from an accident in the past, and I am not down with helping anyone, no matter how sassy they are, scam the public for sympathy dollars.Featured image via Twitter/composite",News,"September 21, 2017",0
13104,Austria's supreme court paves way for same-sex marriage from 2019,"Same-sex couples will be allowed to marry in Austria from 2019, the country s supreme court ruled on Tuesday and said a law to the contrary violated the principle of non-discrimination.  The move brings Austria into line with many other European nations including Germany, France, Britain and Spain. It also comes at a time when stories of sexual harassment under the #MeToo hashtag have flooded social media, sparking a  rethink of attitudes towards sexual discrimination.   Today is a truly historic day,  said lawyer Helmut Graupner, who represented the two female plaintiffs in court.   Austria is the first European country to recognize marriage equality for same-gender couples as a fundamental human right. All the other European states with marriage equality introduced it (just) the political way,  he said in a Facebook post.  Austria s constitutional court examined a 2009 law that allows registered partnerships for same-sex couples but prevents them from getting married. It acted at the request of two women who were rejected by two lower authorities. The distinction between marriage and registered partnership can no longer be upheld without discriminating against same-sex couples, the court said in a statement.   The resulting discriminatory effect is seen in the fact that ... people living in same-sex partnerships have to disclose their sexual orientation even in situations, in which it is not and must not be relevant, and ... are highly likely to be discriminated against,  the court said in its ruling.  The conservative People s Party (OVP), who s leader Sebastian Kurz is expected to be sworn in as chancellor next month, said it will accept the ruling. The far-right Freedom Party (FPO), Kurz s chosen government coalition partner criticized the ruling.  Now there is equal treatment for something that s not equal,  said Herbert Kickl, FPO General Secretary, in a statement. A marriage between women and men needs protection as only these partnerships can create children, he said. The OVP and the FPO voted against same-sex marriage in parliament a few months ago.  The court decision comes days after French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a plan to curb violence against women and weeks after Scotland apologized to gay men for historical convictions. The Homosexual Initiative Vienna (HOSI) welcomed the court s decision.  We are very happy,  said HOSI chairman Christian Hoegl.  We want to use the opportunity for a renewed call for a fundamental reform of marriage.  Same-sex marriage is legal in 25 countries. Australia aims to pass a law to this effect early next month after 62 percent of voters favored marriage equality in a national survey.  In Germany, women and men are allowed to wed to a same sex partner since October. The first country to legalize same-sex marriage was the Netherlands in 2001.",worldnews,"December 5, 2017 ",1
8505,Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm,"scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots. A vaccine is not expected to be ready for widespread use for at least two or three years. U.S. government researchers said they started their first clinical trial of a Zika vaccine. How dangerous is it? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said now that the causal relationship has been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years. According to the World Health Organization, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. In addition, the agency said it could cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. Conclusive proof of the damage caused by Zika may take months or years. Brazil reports the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly at more than 1,700 as doctors and Brazilian health officials find that some suspected cases of microcephaly are not the disorder. Suspected ones under investigation had declined to 3,257. Brazil registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus from February until April 2. Current research in Brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue. What are the symptoms of Zika infection?     People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. The symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito. How can Zika be contained? Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries where they may be exposed to Zika. How widespread is the outbreak? Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 54 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected. (1.usa.gov/1ovAJyh) Africa (1): Cape Verde  Americas (45): Anguilla, Antigua, Argentina, Aruba, Barbados, Barbuda, Belize, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaçao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saba, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelmy, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Eustatius, St. Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Cacos, U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela. Oceania/Pacific Islands (8): American Samoa, Fiji, Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga.  What is the history of the Zika virus? The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO.  Can Zika be transmitted through sexual contact? The World Health Organization (WHO) said sexual transmission is “relatively common” and has advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus. It also  advised women living in areas where the virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant. The U.S. CDC is investigating about a dozen cases of possible sexual transmission. Those cases involved possible transmission of the virus from men to their sex partners. But the CDC issued updated recommendations for preventing and testing for Zika infection on July 25, warning that the virus can be transmitted through unprotected sex with an infected female partner. A reported case of female-to-male sexual transmission in New York City, and limited human and non-human primate data indicating that Zika virus RNA can be detected in vaginal secretions, led to the new warning, the agency said. CDC’s expanded warnings on sexual exposure to Zika now  caution against sex without a condom or other barrier method of protection with any person, male or female, who has traveled to or lives in an area with Zika, including female to female transmission with a pregnant partner. British health officials reported Zika was found in a man’s semen two months after he was infected, suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade. The PAHO said Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism. There is no evidence Zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk. The WHO has identified Zika cases in Argentina, Chile, France, Italy and New Zealand as likely caused by sexual transmission.  What other complications are associated with Zika? Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue.",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 ",1
13906,"North Korea's wounded defector 'nice guy,' likes CSI: surgeon","North Korea s latest defector, a young soldier known only by his family name Oh, is a quiet, pleasant man who has nightmares about being returned to the North, his surgeon said on Thursday.  He s a pretty nice guy,  said lead surgeon John Cook-Jong Lee, who has been operating and caring for the 24-year-old. Oh has become a focus of worldwide attention after he was badly wounded by fellow North Korean soldiers as he scrambled across the border in the Demilitarized Zone that separates North and South on Nov. 13. Video of Oh s escape released on Wednesday showed him stumbling over the border and being dragged unconscious through the undergrowth by South Korean troops. Surgeon Lee has been almost the only person to speak with Oh since he arrived at the hospital, he told Reuters in an interview at his office at Ajou University Hospital, just a few floors away from where the defector lies guarded by South Korean special forces and intelligence officers. The surgeon, who has hung a South Korean flag in the soldier s room, said he is avoiding subjects that may disturb his patient. Oh is eating his first  clear liquid  food such as broths, and can smile, talk, and use his hands, Lee said. But when his patient woke on Sunday he cried out in pain, and Lee said he is still anxious about the South Korean guards. Lee said Oh told him that he had joined the North Korean army when he was 17, right after secondary school graduation. The soldier s hair is styled  like a jarhead, like a U.S. Marine, so I actually joked  why don t you join the South Korean Marines?  He smiled and said that he would never ever go back to the military system again.  Medical teams have worked for days to remove the shards of at least four bullets from Oh s body, stitch up his shredded organs, and treat pre-existing conditions including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and a case of massive intestinal worms, Lee said.  He s a quite strong man,  said Lee.  Since Oh s defection, North Korea appeared to have replaced all its security guards on the border, an intelligence source in the South told Yonhap news agency on Thursday.  Lee said that when the defector arrived in an American military helicopter at the hospital   which is equipped with state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment and is used to treat VIP visitors such as visiting U.S. presidents - he came with zero personal information. On the flight in, American army flight medics had fought to keep Oh alive, jabbing a large needle into his chest to treat a collapsed lung.   Oh was immediately wheeled into a diagnostic room where doctors confirmed he was suffering from massive internal bleeding.  We knew then that we didn t have time to hesitate,  Lee said, standing in that room Thursday night. Two major surgeries were required to remove the bullets and patch Oh back together, and the medical team pumped as much as 12 liters of new blood into his body. The normal body has less than half as much blood.  He told me that he is so thankful for South Koreans for saving his life and giving him that much blood,  Lee said. Lee has been playing South Korean pop music and American films and TV shows for his patient, but has not exposed him to any news coverage. Among the shows, Oh showed a liking for the French-American thriller  Transporter 3,  comedy  Bruce Almighty  starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman; and the crime-solving TV series  CSI,  Lee said. Most North Korean defectors undergo security questioning by South Korea s intelligence agency once they arrive in the South before being sent to a resettlement center for a three-month education on life in the South. After they are released, central and local governments provide 7 million won ($6,450) in cash over a year, as well as support in housing, education and job training. Police officers are assigned to each of the defectors to ensure their security and safety. Even if Oh fully recovers, some scars will stay for the rest of his life, the surgeon said.  Among the longest lasting wounds will be the damage to his colon, which was shredded by a bullet and had to be stitched back together in seven places.  It s a lifelong complication for the patient, so he s better to be very cautious in his diet,  said the surgeon. Besides the potential for further medical complications, Lee says he is most worried about making sure Oh recovers psychologically. The soldier has already told him he had a nightmare about being returned to the North.  The surgeon said he has asked senior South Korean military officials who are eager to question the soldier to hold off  while he recovers.  This North Korean guy is not going anywhere,  Lee said.  He is staying in South Korea. So we don t need to be hasty.",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",0
11717,Senior Saudi prince says Trump's Jerusalem move threatens stability,"U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital will stoke violence in the region, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said, dismissing reports of prior consultations made with Riyadh over the move.   It is a very bad decision. The consequences will be more bloodshed, more conflict rather than peaceful resolution,  Prince Turki, a senior royal family member and a former ambassador to Washington, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday in Riyadh. Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy and veered from international consensus this month by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Most countries say the city s status must be left to negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Saudi Arabia condemned the decision. Saudi King Salman told President Trump that any decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem before a permanent peace settlement is reached will inflame the feelings of Muslims, official media reported. But Saudi Arabia stopped short of calling for any Arab action against the decision. Palestinian officials say Riyadh has been working for weeks behind the scenes to press them to support a nascent U.S. peace plan.  The reaction here was total surprise,  said Prince Turki, who now holds no government office but remains influential.   ... If there has been prior consultation or anything like that, why would the King go through the process of telling him (Trump) this is a bad idea and make that known publicly?    I don t think there ever was any discussion of this  before the decision was taken, he added. As regards possible Saudi and Arab action in response to Trump s decision, Prince Turki said:  I am sure lots of people would prefer to have something just for the sake of appearance but I don t think that s how the Saudi government operates. If it is going to take action, it is going to be a serious action.  Four Palestinian officials, who spoke on condition they not be named, said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have discussed in detail a grand bargain that Trump and Jared Kushner, the president s son-in-law and adviser, are expected to unveil in the first half of 2018. Arab officials say the plan is still in its early phases of development.  Prince Turki said he was unaware of details of any such  plan. Prince Turki is a son of King Faisal, who was assassinated in 1975. His brother, Saud al-Faisal, served as foreign minister for 40 years until 2015, and their branch of the family is seen as influential over Saudi foreign policy, even as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has solidified his authority. Prince Saud championed a 2002 Arab peace initiative which called for normalizing relations between Arab countries and Israel in return for Israel s withdrawal from lands occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. In a letter to Trump published in a Saudi newspaper on Dec. 11, Prince Turki said that Trump s  opportunistic  Jerusalem move would threaten security in the region.  The now much diminished terrorist international gets a rejuvenation boost from you and re-energizes its recruitment of volunteers to broaden their murderous attacks on innocent civilians, worldwide,  he wrote in his letter. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said he would encourage a more moderate and tolerant version of Islam in the ultra-conservative kingdom. The ambitious young prince has already taken some steps to loosen Saudi Arabia s ultra-strict social restrictions, scaling back the role of religious morality police, permitting public concerts and announcing plans to allow women to drive next year. Prince Turki said that Saudis share in the blame for the spread of extremist ideology through funding of mosques abroad that may have fallen into the wrong hands, but that such funding stopped since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.    The kingdom has been the victim of such people and such activity... Since Sept. 11 the kingdom has had a sustained and continuous program opposing extremist ideology, not just in the kingdom but abroad,  he told Reuters.     For a period of time, yes it is true there were some Saudis who promoted issues of extremism and so on. Now we are getting rid of all of those. I would say we have gotten rid of most of them, if not all of them.",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",1
7428,"Czech president very happy with Trump win, says shares his views","Czech President Milos Zeman declared on Wednesday he was “very happy” with Donald Trump’s election victory, saying he cut through political correctness and addressed key issues like migration. Zeman, who is head of the NATO and European Union member state but does not steer day-to-day policies, endorsed Trump in September. “I would like to cordially congratulate Donald Trump. I had, as one of few European politicians, declared public support for this candidate... because I agree with his opinions on migration as well as the fight against Islamic terrorism,” Zeman told reporters in a rare press briefing at the Prague Castle. Zeman’s reaction chimed with Hungarian leader Viktor Orban but contrasted with shock in many European capitals. Unlike the current Czech center-left administration, Zeman shares Trump’s warm relations toward Russian leader Vladimir Putin and opposition to liberal and academic elites. “I appreciate Donald Trump’s public demeanor, he speaks clearly, sometimes roughly, but understandably, and avoids what is sometimes called political correctness,” Zeman said. He said the election showed American voters’ resistance to manipulation by the media, another frequent target of both Trump and Zeman. The Czech president said he had sent congratulations to Trump and invited him to visit the Czech Republic, the birthplace of Trump’s ex-wife Ivana. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said Trump had won on “aggressive populism” but added he believed the United States would remain a reliable partner and ally.",politicsNews,"November 9, 2016 ",1
15843,Kurds offer joint border deployment as Iraq threatens more military operations,"Iraq s Kurdish region said on Thursday it had offered a joint Kurdish-Iraqi deployment at a strategic crossing into Turkey with the participation of U.S.-led international forces as part of a compromise aimed at ending a stand-off with Baghdad. The offer was disclosed hours after the Iraqi armed forces threatened to resume military operations against the Kurds, accusing them of delaying the handover of control of borders and taking advantage of negotiations to bolster their defenses. The central government in Baghdad has cracked down hard on the Kurds since the government of the Kurdish autonomous region staged an independence referendum on Sept. 25 that Baghdad considers illegal. Central government forces swiftly seized swathes of Kurdish-held territory last month and have demanded control of all border checkpoints, including the Turkish frontier which has been controlled by the Kurds since the Saddam Hussein era. Over the past week, the Kurds have tried to defuse the crisis with negotiations. The Kurdish defense department said the offer for joint control of the frontier was part of a  deconfliction  proposal made to Baghdad on Oct. 31. Other proposals included a ceasefire on all fronts, continued cooperation in the fight against Islamic State and joint deployments in so-called disputed territories claimed by both the Kurds and the Iraqi central government. The KRG  continues to welcome a permanent ceasefire on all fronts, deconfliction and the start of a political dialogue  with Baghdad, the Kurdish statement said. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi suspended military operations against the Kurds on Friday. The sides have since held talks which Baghdad says cover only technical issues, with political questions off the table unless the Kurds discard the referendum. Iran and Turkey back Abadi s tough line, fearing a drive for independence could spread to their own Kurdish populations.  The Kurdish statement said the offer of a joint deployment at the strategic Fish-Khabur crossing was meant  as a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi Constitution . Fish-Khabur is strategically vital for the landlocked Kurds as the point where oil from northern Iraq crosses into Turkey. Iraq wants the Kurdistan region to stop exporting its own oil and hand over sales to the Iraqi state-oil marketer SOMO, the company s director said on Thursday. Iraq is talking to Turkey to let SOMO sell Kurdish crude that arrives by pipeline, acting SOMO director general Alaa al-Yasiri told reporters. The Iraqi Joint Operations Command accused the Kurds on Wednesday of using the talks  buy time  to strengthen positions.  We will not allow it; the federal forces are mandated to secure (the disputed) areas and borders,  it said in a statement. The command of the Kurdish security forces, known as Peshmerga, accused Iraqi troops of massing weapons and threatening force to resolve  domestic political differences . The office of the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq said more than 183,000 civilians had been displaced by the conflict, including 79,000 from Kirkuk city which Baghdad captured on the first day of its offensive last month.  A humanitarian official involved in the relief efforts said more than three quarters of the displaced are Kurds. Iraqi troops set up positions on Tuesday at the Turkish border for the first time, between Turkish and Kurdish checkpoints at Habur, the Turkish name for the road border crossing located 10 km from Fish-Khabur in Iraq. The Turkish frontier with Iraqi Kurdistan is a critical security issue for Turkey, which says Kurdish insurgents fighting against the Turkish state shelter across it. Turkish security forces killed 17 Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants near the border, the Turkish armed forces said on Thursday, after eight members of Turkey s security forces were killed in clashes. The Kurdish militants were intercepted crossing the border into Turkey, the Turkish military said.",worldnews,"November 2, 2017 ",0

3897,NC Republicans PROUDLY Brag About How Well Their Voter Suppression Tactics Are Working,"While the Supreme Court blocked the worst of North Carolina s voter suppression laws (including their voter ID law, and their decisions to cut early voting and end same-day registration across the state), the state s Republican Party still managed to find ways to cut early voting to harm the state s black citizens, as well as intimidate them into not voting. Sickeningly, it seems to have worked.And they re bragging about it in a press release. Openly. Loudly. Proudly. Gleefully. The title reads,  NCGOP Sees Encouraging Early Voting, Obama/Clinton Coalition Tired, Fail to Resonate in North Carolina. That would all well and good if it were actually true. What they re really doing, though, is bragging about lower black voter turnout and higher white voter turnout.  North Carolina Obama Coalition Crumbling,  is the heading of one section of the release, and it highlights the decrease in black voter turnout in the state between 2012 and now.Image via NC GOPSure, whites and minorities are two different demographics, but keep in mind that the Supreme Court blocked their voter suppression law because  the new provisions targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision.  In response to that, Governor Pat McCrory threw a tantrum, and the state went about finding other ways of suppressing voters.The party s solution to the Supreme Court s ruling was to pressure individual county boards to limit early voting, especially Sunday voting, and many did despite the fact that the black community overwhelmingly votes early, and often on Sunday after church. The state s elections board mitigated some of these restrictions, but not all, and the black and student communities were still disproportionately harmed.Other states in the South have shown increases of black voters during early voting as much as 18 percent in one case but North Carolina saw a sharp decline:Something went very wrong for African-Americans  voting in North Carolina pic.twitter.com/ZpwjyEavmd  Michael McDonald (@ElectProject) November 6, 2016What s happened is that Republicans knew they d lose the state if minority voters were able to vote more easily because they tend to vote Democratic. A longtime GOP consultant even said that, if black voters voted Republican, none of these suppression tactics would ever have been considered.It s bad enough that they ve worked so hard to severely curtail the right to vote in order to maintain control of the state, and try and deliver a White House win to Herr Trump. To openly brag about it like this, though? They just reinforced the fact that this was literally about suppressing votes, not ensuring voting rights remained intact and without fraud.Featured image by Brian Blanco via Getty Images",News,"November 7, 2016",0

17909,"Globalization, migration fears reawaken Germans' interest in 'Heimat'","Most Germans are wary of anything that smacks of nationalism given their Nazi history but the concept of  Heimat  (homeland) is enjoying a renaissance driven by rising anxiety about migration and globalization. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier used the resonant word 18 times in marking the 27th anniversary of German reunification on Tuesday, saying the nation needed honest dialogue about immigration after taking in over a million migrants since 2015.  Cem Ozdemir, head of the environmental Greens party, applauded Steinmeier for reclaiming the word from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which emphasized nationalist and anti-immigrant themes to capture around 13 percent of the vote in the Sept. 24 national election. Germany s post-war history included migration from Italy, Turkey, Greece and eastern Europe, but it has resisted thinking of itself as a country of immigrants. That is changing now amid calls for a proper immigration law to differentiate between political refugees and economic migrants. Along with that has come new soul-searching about what it means to be German, as well as resurgent demand for dirndls (traditional Alpine dresses), cuckoo clocks, local foods and mystery novels set in regions like the northern island of Sylt.  Raed Saleh, a Berlin politician whose Palestinian parents moved to Germany from the Israeli-occupied West Bank when he was five, said he was reminded of his own identity struggles when he spoke at a high school in Berlin s Wedding district - where 90 percent of the students come from immigrant families.  I saw really talented, engaged people and I want them - and all children in Germany - to feel that they belong here,  said Saleh.  I didn t have that feeling myself for a long time.  In his book,  German Me: The New Guiding Culture  published earlier this year, Saleh called for a more inclusive  common vision  for Germany and its 82 million people. His book is one of over a dozen published over the past year that explore German identity and the concept of homeland. Susanne Weingarten, who oversaw production of a special issue of Der Spiegel magazine dedicated to  Heimat , said interest by both rightists and liberal young  hipsters  pointed to a certain rootlessness in Germany that had been exacerbated by digitalization, globalization and the migration crisis.  In Germany, it s a scorched concept because of National Socialism,  she said, referring to Nazism.  The attempt to define  Heimat  for oneself is difficult. That s something that only the young generation born 50 to 60 years after the Holocaust can do unselfconsciously.  Christian Schuele, whose book  Heimat: A Phantom Pain  was published this spring, says the trend and support for far-right parties is driven by a sense of loss of national identity as immigration has surged, especially for those whose towns have shriveled and where local traditions have died out. The current debate is long overdue, he says, noting the election revealed deep cracks in society caused by the lack of integration of many from the country s formerly communist east, and others, such as those with backgrounds in Russia and Turkey.  It s definitely a topic that moves people,  said Bianca Kroemer, spokeswoman for Berlin s Dussmann bookstore, which has a whole section focused on the issue.  Heimat  is in vogue,  agreed Juergen Kron, managing director of the Duesseldorf-based Droste Verlag, whose focus on regional titles had kept sales up despite the overall drop in the publishing market. National pride became acceptable for the first time since the Nazi era during the summer of 2006, when Germans reveled in their hosting of the soccer World Cup by waving flags long associated only with the far-right. In recent years, the  buy local  movement has fueled interest in regional books of all kinds, Kron said. Next week s Frankfurt Book Fair will feature nearly a dozen events related to the subject of homeland. Dorothea Suh, a 33-year-old music teacher in Hamburg whose parents came from South Korea two years before her birth, worries that the discussion about German identity comes too late and that other parties will ultimately co-opt the AfD s agenda. Stung by recent experiences - including a neighbor yelling  Foreigners out,  Suh is actively planning to emigrate.  Germany is my home. I don t want to leave, but I m starting to feel like a stranger in my own country,  Suh said.  I don t want to wait too long and then find myself facing closed doors.",worldnews,"October 5, 2017 ",0
21205,SWEDEN IS ON BRINK OF COLLAPSE… Gun Purchases Are Way Up…Pepper Spray Selling Out…Muslims Beating Non-Muslims On Streets,"The politically correct country of Sweden paying a very big price for their kindness, generosity and open-borders policy This attack happened in Norrmalmstorg, Stockholm. The two Swedes told them not to vandalize flowerpots   and as a response they got beaten up for it.https://youtu.be/Rsn_1TO1kMUThis is indeed the future of Europe. By their irresponsible, short-sighted, suicidal immigration and refugee policies, Europe s political and media elites have ensured a future of violence, bloodshed and chaos for their people. Sweden, the future of Europe: people stock up on fire arms, police recommend vigilante groups ,  by Nicolai Sennels, 10News.dk, December 12, 2015 (thanks to TheReligionofPeace.com):This is a very interesting read, because the whole of Europe is heading the same way as Sweden. Sweden is, so to speak, the future of Europe. And in this future, those who can afford it pay security companies   the rest gest license for firearms and forms vigilante groups. via: Pamela Gellar You have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village. They can see what has happened in other places.    Salesman for alarm systems.Since Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by over 300% and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.The violence at the hands of Muslim migrants  is nothing new to Sweden. This horrific video was published in 2013:Many Swedes see the mass immigration as a forced marriage: Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose, yet she is expected to love and honor him, even though he beats her and treats her badly. Her parents (the government) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him. Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated?    Alexandra von Schwerin, whose farm who was robbed three times. Police refused to help.Once upon a time, there was a safe welfare state called Sweden, where people rarely locked their doors.Now, this country is a night-watchman state   each man is on his own. When the Minister of Justice, Morgan Johansson, encourages breaking the law, it means opening the gates to anarchy. Mr. and Mrs. Swede have every reason to be worried, with the influx of 190,000 unskilled and unemployed migrants expected this year   equivalent to 2% of Sweden s current population. The number is as if 6.4 million penniless migrants who did not speak English arrived in U.S. in one year, or 1.3 million in Britain.And the Swedes are preparing: demand for firearms licenses is increasing; more and more Swedes are joining shooting clubs and starting vigilante groups. After a slight dip in 2014, the number of new gun permits has gone up significantly again this year. According to police statistics, there are 1,901,325 licensed guns, owned by 567,733 people, in Sweden. Add to this an unknown number of illegal weapons. To get a gun permit in Sweden, you need to be at least 18 years old; law-abiding; well-behaved, and have a hunting license or be a member of an approved shooting club. In 2014, 11,000 people got a hunting license: 10% more than the year before. One out of five was a woman. There is also a high demand for alarm systems right now,  says a salesman at one of the security companies in an interview with Gatestone. It is largely due to the turbulence we are seeing around the country at the moment.  People have lost confidence in the State, he added.  The police will not come anymore. Truck drivers say that when they see a thief emptying the fuel tank of their trucks, they run out with a baseball bat. It is no use calling the police, but if you hit the thief, you can at least prevent him from stealing more diesel. Many homeowners say the same thing: they sleep with a baseball bat under the bed. But this is risky: the police can then say you have been prepared to use force, and that might backfire on you. The salesman, who asked to remain anonymous, also spoke of Sweden s many Facebook groups, in which people in different villages openly discuss how they intend to protect themselves:  Sometimes you get totally freaked out when you see what they are writing. But you have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house opens in their village. They can see what has happened in other places. One blog, detailing the consequences for the local population when an asylum facility opens, is aptly named Asylkaos ( Asylum Chaos ). There is a list of companies the reader is prompted to boycott; the blog claims these businesses encourage the transformation of Sweden to a multicultural society, and are therefore considered  hostile to Swedes. At another security company, a salesman said that every time the Immigration Service buys or rents a new housing facility, his firm is swamped with calls.  The next day,  he said,  half the village calls and wants to buy alarm systems. Ronny Fredriksson, spokesman of the security company Securitas, said that the demand for home alarm systems first exploded about six years ago, when many local police stations were shut down and police moved to the main towns. This, he said, could result in response times of several hours.  More and more people now employ the services of our security guards. Shopping malls and stores in the city come together and hire guards. We are kind of like the  local beat  cops of old. Even though Securitas makes big money from the increased need for home security alarms and security guards, Fredriksson says they also are worried about the effect on society: The problem is that we too need the police. When our guards catch a burglar or a violent person, we call the police but the response times are often very long. Sometimes, the detainees get violent and quite rowdy. On occasion, the police have told us to release the person we have apprehended, if we have his identity, because they do not have a patrol nearby. Even before the massive influx of migrants in the fall of 2015, Swedes felt a need to protect themselves   and with good reason. Since the Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by more than 300%, and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.The politicians, however, ignore the people s fear completely. It is never discussed. Instead, the people who express concern about what kind of country Sweden has become are accused of xenophobia and racism. Most likely, that is the reason more and more people are taking matters into their own hands, and protecting themselves and their families to the best of their ability.All the same, some people do not settle for that. It seems some people are trying to stop mass immigration to Sweden. Almost every day there are reports of fires being set at asylum houses. So far, miraculously, no one has been hurt.These fires are set not only by Swedes. On October 13, a 36-year-old woman living in Skellefte  was convicted of setting fire to the asylum facility in which she herself resided. The woman claimed she lit a candle and then fell asleep. Yet forensic evidence showed that a combustible fluid had been doused throughout the room, and the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that she herself had ignited the fire.The number of violent incidents at Sweden s Immigration Service facilities is now sky-high. In 2013, according to Dispatch International, at least one incident happened every day. When Gatestone Institute recently acquired the incident list for January 1, 2014 through October 29, 2015, that number had risen to 2,177 incidents of threats, violence and brawls   on average, three per day.The Swedish government, however, would apparently rather not talk about that. Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr m conceded, in an interview with the daily Dagens Nyheter that garnered international attention, that Sweden is, in fact, heading for a systemic breakdown: Most people seem to think we cannot maintain a system where perhaps 190,000 people will arrive every year. In the long run, our system will collapse. This welcome is not going to receive popular support. We want to give people who come here a worthy reception. Symptomatic of Swedish journalists, this statement was tucked away at the end of the article. The headline was about how the political party that is critical of immigration, the Sweden Democrats Party (Sverigedemokraterna), is responsible for the asylum-housing fires. But foreign media, such as The Daily Mail and Russia Today, picked up Wallstr m s warning about a systemic collapse and ran it as the urgent news it actually is.Nevertheless, in official Sweden, the imminent collapse is ignored. Instead, journalists exclusively focus on attacks by supposedly  racist  Swedes on refugee centers. To prevent new fires, the Immigration Service decided on October 28 that from now on, all asylum facilities would have secret addresses. And meager police resources will now be stretched even further   to protect asylum seekers. Police helicopters will even patrol refugee centers. But considering there are only five helicopters available, and that Sweden s landmass is 407,340 square km (157,274 square miles), this gesture is effectively empty.At a meeting with the Nordic Council in Reykjavik, Iceland, on October 27, Sweden s Prime Minister, Stefan L fven, was questioned by his Nordic colleagues about the situation in Sweden. L fven had recently said that,  We should have the option of relocating people applying for asylum in Sweden to other EU-countries. Our ability, too, has a limit. We are facing a paradigm shift.  That comment led a representative of Finland s Finns Party (Sannfinl ndarna) to wonder, with a hint of irony, how mass immigration to Sweden, which for years Swedish politicians have touted as being so profitable, has now suddenly become a burden.Another Finns Party representative, Simon Elo, pointed out that the situation in Sweden is out of control.  Sweden has great abilities, but not even the Swedes have abilities that great,  Elo said.When L fven was asked how he is dealing with the real concerns and demands of the citizenry, his answer was laconic:  Of course I understand there is concern,  L fven said.  It is not easy. But at the same time   there are 60 million people on the run. This is also about them being our fellow men, and I hope that viewpoint will prevail. The daily tabloid Expressen asked L fven about the attacks on asylum facilities. He replied,  Our communities should not be characterized by threats and violence, they should be warm and show solidarity. As if such behavior can be forced.Many Swedes see mass immigration as a forced marriage: Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose, yet she is expected to love and honor him even though he beats her and treats her badly. And on top of that, her parents (the government) tell her to be warm and show solidarity with him.More and more Swedish commentators are now drawing the same conclusion: that Sweden is teetering on the brink of collapse. Editorial columnist Ivar Arpi of the daily Svenska Dagbladet, wrote an astonishing article on October 26, about a woman named Alexandra von Schwerin and her husband. The couple lives on the Skarhults Estate farm in Sk ne in southern Sweden; they have been robbed three times. Most recently, they were robbed of a quad bike, a van and a car. When the police arrived, von Schwerin asked them what she should do. The police told her that they could not help her.  All our resources are on loan to the asylum reception center in Trelleborg and Malm ,  they said.  We are overloaded right now. So I suggest you get in touch with the vigilante group in Esl v. What the police had called a  vigilante group  turned out to be a group of private business owners. In 2013, after being robbed more or less every night, they had decided to come together and start patrolling the area themselves. Currently, they pay a security firm to watch their facilities. On principal, I am totally against it,  von Schwerin said.  What are the people who cannot afford private security to do? They will be unprotected. I m sure I will join, but very, very reluctantly. For the first time, I feel scared to live here now. Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated? Commenting on the police s encouraging people to join vigilante groups, social commentator and former Refugee Ombudsman Merit Wager wrote: So, the Swedes are supposed to arrange and pay for their own and their families  security and keep their farms from being subjected to theft, even though that has up to now been included in the social contract   for which we pay high taxes, to have police we can count on to protect us and apprehend criminals?! When did the social contract expire? October 2015? Without any notice of termination, since the tax-consuming party is not fulfilling its part of the deal? This should mean that our part of the deal   to pay taxes for public, joint services   has also become invalid? If the social contract is broken, it is broken. Then it is musical chairs (lawlessness, defenselessness, without protection), and that means that each and every one of us should pay less taxes. Ilan Sad , lawyer and social commentator, wrote about the refugee chaos at Malm  Central Train Station on the blog Det Goda Samh llet on October 27:  The authorities no longer honor the social contract.  He described four large signs on display around the station that read  Refugee? Welcome to Malm !  in four different languages. It is unclear who the sender of the message is, or, for that matter, who is in charge of the reception facility   a number of barracks by the old post office in the inner harbor. Everything is utterly confusing. It could be Malm  City or the Immigration Service, but it might as well be  Refugees Welcome,  or possibly a religious community. I think to myself that a government agency could not reasonably write like this, a correct and pertinent sign would say something like:  Asylum seekers are referred to the barracks for information and further transport.  But I am probably wrong; Malm  City is the chief suspect communicant.   The signs in and around the Central Station are symptoms of something incredibly serious: Role confusion and the decay of the constitutional state. And thus, that our authorities no longer honor the social contract. In a post called Anarchy, blogger Johan Westerholm, who is a Social Democratic Party member and a critic of the government, wrote that the Minister for Justice and Migration, Morgan Johansson, is now urging authorities to  be pragmatic  about laws and regulations (concerning asylum housing for so-called unaccompanied refugee children). Westerholm stated that this is tantamount to the government  opening the gates to anarchy : Our country is founded on law; Parliament legislates and the courts apply these. Morgan Johansson s statement and his otherwise passive approach are testimony to how this, our kind of democracy, may fade into a memory very shortly. He now laid the first brick in the building of a state that rests on other principles. Anarchism. If anarchy really does break out, it would be good to remember that there are nearly two million licensed firearms in Sweden. Sweden s shooting clubs have seen a surge in interest; many are welcoming a lot of new members lately. Via: Gatestone Institute",left-news,"Dec 19, 2015",0

Evetns turned violent after protesters hurled projectiles at police, and also set fires to makeshift barricades erected on the street in front of the US Embassy secure compound, located north of Beirut, Lebanon.Protesters also reportedly burned US, Israeli flags and an effigy of US President Donald Trump.Later, angry protestors manged to pull down a portion of the front metal gates to the US Embassy.Lebanese security forces deployed tear gas and water cannons to try and repel angry mobs.Reuters reports: Late on Saturday Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo urged the United States to abandon its decision and said the move would spur violence throughout the region.Israel says that all of Jerusalem is its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state.Most countries consider East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after capturing it in a 1967 war, to be occupied territory and say the status of the city should be left to be decided at future Israeli-Palestinian talks.The government of Lebanon, which hosts about 450,000 Palestinian refugees, has condemned Trump s decision. Lebanese President Michel Aoun last week called the move a threat to regional stability.The powerful Iran-backed Lebanese Shi ite group Hezbollah on Thursday said it backed calls for a new Palestinian uprising against Israel in response to the U.S. decision.Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah also called for a protest against the decision in the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs of Beirut on Monday.

5033,Senate committee approves Trump intelligence nominee Coats,"The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee voted overwhelmingly on Thursday in favor of President Donald Trump’s nominee to be director of national intelligence, former Republican Senator Dan Coats, sending his nomination to the Senate floor. The vote, which took place in a closed hearing, was 13-2, the committee said. Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Kamala Harris were the only two members to vote no. Coats must still be confirmed by the full Senate to be the top U.S. intelligence official. The popular former lawmaker, who also served as ambassador to Germany, is expected to be confirmed easily. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to oversee all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies and improve communications among them. Coats, 73, replaces James Clapper, who retired as President Barack Obama left office. Coats was a member of the Senate intelligence panel until he retired from the Senate at the end of last year. He pledged during his confirmation hearing on Feb. 28 to support a thorough investigation of any Russian effort to influence the 2016 presidential election. Wyden, one of the Senate’s leading privacy advocates, said he voted against his former colleague because he felt that the office of the Director of National Intelligence had not provided the committee with enough information about how many Americans’ communication records have been subjected to government surveillance. “Given that there has not been a firm commitment to deliver this critical information, I cannot support any DNI nominee without that material,” Wyden said in a statement. Harris said that after consideration of Coats’ record on a range of issues, she concluded she could not support his nomination. Senators Richard Burr, the committee’s Republican chairman, and Mark Warner, its top Democrat, both said they were pleased the committee had backed Coats. Warner said he was confident that Coats, as a former committee member, had respect for the panel’s oversight responsibilities.",politicsNews,"March 9, 2017 ",0
4268,Dan Rather BURIES Trump In Epic Post-Debate Analysis That Everyone Should See,"This is why we miss Dan Rather at the CBS News desk.At a time when the media often fails to dig deep and ask the hard hitting questions all for the sake of ratings, at least we still can rely on Dan Rather to deliver an analysis that makes people think.After the debate on Sunday night, the legendary newsman delivered a damning criticism of the Republican nominee and warned Americans of the dire consequences of this election. I am not sure it is possible to truly put into words what we witnessed tonight,  Rather wrote.  This election has long since passed the stage of rationality and reason, the realm of the written page, and into the territory of the heart and spirit, where emotions swirl that we cannot fully distill into coherent sentences and paragraphs. But I will humbly try Rather launched into talking about the Roman Empire and the barbarism that eventually led to its downfall. The debate last night was like watching a fight to the death between gladiators at the Colosseum.  I had a sense we could, if we are not vigilant, fall into a similar downward spiral,  Rather noted.But Rather was pleased with how the moderators did their job, praising Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz for demanding specifics from both candidates.Trump, of course, whined about the tough questions and that resulted in a meltdown that lasted throughout the evening as Trump preferred personal smears instead of actually giving the American people an idea of what his policies are and how he will enact them. Dan Rather definitely noticed the differences between the two presidential contenders.Trump went on the offensive, as advertised, drilling down to an attack on Bill Clinton. It was a strategy that was all Trump. And HIllary Clinton responded with a volley of all the other insulting statements and lies by Trump over the course of the election season. As Trump preened, paced and swayed, Clinton s steely face spoke volumes. As Trump stood, looming over Clinton, threatening her with a special prosecutor and even imprisonment, the optics of the GOP nominee could be seen as either that of a schoolyard bully or a determined pugilist depending on your point of view. Clinton was better answering questions directly and better at laying out what she would like to do as President. Trump was more determined to levy personal attacks to put Clinton on defensive, especially in the early going.Clinton engaged mostly with the audience and moderators. Donald Trump addressed her directly with hand gestures and eye contact. When she spoke, he sometimes stood pacing, or passively, gripping his chair. When he spoke, he often tried to tar his opponent with guilt by association   calling into question Clinton s  friends  on taxes in particular and referring to Clinton s husband to avoid the glare of his own misconduct. It seems that Trump does everything he can to avoid personal culpability or responsibility. He argues that his faults are not so great because Clinton and her associates have done much worse   his words are not so dangerous because  locker room  talk has long been excused for men. Clinton called for an apology to the many Trump has spoken ill of. None was forthcoming. I can t see any of that moving the needle compared to the tsunami that has engulfed the race in the past few days.In conclusion, Rather talked about the need for all of us to be engaged if we want to end this national nightmare and get back to the business of dealing with our problems with reasonable solutions. We have serious problems facing our nation, and our world,  Rather wrote.Our ship of state must be prepared to navigate the perilous shoals of our complicated world   and yet I feel tonight as if we have been hijacked into an alternate universe. This national nightmare will end one way or another and we will awaken to the same world from which we have been so disengaged. That is our challenge and it is a challenge from which none of us can opt out.Here s the full post via Facebook.Donald Trump must be stopped before our country turns into a barbaric nation that is primed to fall like Rome did. Hate, ignorance, violence, and fear will not make America great again. It will be our end. And that can only be prevented by the American people on November 8th by making sure Trump nevers sees the inside of the White House.Featured Image: Larry Busacca/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2016",0
15234,JUDGE WHO JAILED KIM DAVIS HAS A HISTORY OF PUSHING HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA IN SCHOOLS,"Another activist liberal judge who s denying First Amendment rights to Americans. This is very interesting information and the thing that stood out to me is the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Bunning s decision.The federal judge who held Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis in contempt and ordered her to jail for refusing to sign marriage licenses has on two occasions denied Christian students in Kentucky public schools their First Amendment rights by ordering them to undergo re-education training promoting the homosexual lifestyle against their religious objections.In 2003, Federal District Judge David Bunning ordered Boyd County education officials to implement training, which mandated school staff and students undergo diversity education principally  devoted to issues of sexual orientation and gender harassment. A number of students objected to being forced to watch a gaystapo propaganda video denouncing Christian views that opposed homosexuality as wrongheaded and proclaiming homosexuality as a safe, healthy, and fixed lifestyle that cannot be changed.When it was discovered that students would be punished if they didn t undergo the training their parents brought in the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) legal organization, which sued the Boyd County Board of Education.In 2006, the gaystapo tool was back at it. Once again he tried to force Christian students to watch a gaystapo propaganda video promoting the homosexual lifestyle, and denying Christian students the ability to opt out of the indoctrination training. Bunning ruled that an opt-out was unnecessary because the training didn t mean that students would have to change their religious beliefs.Bunning s decision was overturned in October 2007 by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Court ruled that a Christian student could seek damages from the school district because the training Bunning imposed had  chilled  the student s ability to express his Christian beliefs about homosexuality to his fellow students.Via: CFP",politics,"Sep 5, 2015",1
6859,"Trump says 'nothing funny' about 'Saturday Night Live,' but audience soars","U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday doubled down on his scorn for satirical TV show “Saturday Night Live,” whose popularity has soared since Alec Baldwin began impersonating him in the final weeks leading up to the election. Trump, a guest host on “Saturday Night Live” in November 2015 when he was running for the Republican presidential nomination, has vented his anger on Twitter in recent weeks, calling the NBC show “totally unwatchable” and a “hit-job.” In an interview on NBC’s “Today” show on Wednesday, Trump was asked whether he had considered no longer watching it, given his complaints. “I hosted ‘SNL’ when it was a good show, but it’s not a good show anymore,” Trump responded. “First of all, nothing to do with me, there’s nothing funny about it. The skits are terrible.” The show’s audience has jumped 33 percent since Baldwin began impersonating Trump in October, according to NBC. The network said some 11.4 million people on average are watching the program this season, starting Oct. 1, making it the most-watched season since 1992. Trump on Wednesday attempted to cast doubt on the future of “Saturday Night Live,” which has lampooned presidents and politicians from both parties since it first aired 41 years ago.  “Frankly, the way the show is going now, if you look at the kind of work they’re doing, who knows how long that show’s going to be on. It’s a terrible show,” Trump said. The Republican businessman and former star of NBC’s reality TV show “The Apprentice” also said Baldwin’s depiction of him was “really mean-spirited and not very good.” “I do like him and I like him as an actor, but I don’t think his imitation of me gets me at all,” Trump added. Baldwin, who has portrayed Trump as unprepared for office or tweeting during security briefings, tweeted back to Trump last week, “Release your tax returns and I’ll stop. Ha.”  Trump broke with decades of tradition followed by both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates by refusing to release his tax returns. Baldwin, 58, the former star of NBC’s comedy “30 Rock,” told celebrity magazine Hola! in an interview, that he was glad other people found his impressions funny after a divisive election. “There are bad feelings on both sides, so to have the opportunity to give people a chance to talk and laugh about it is a good thing,” Baldwin told the U.S. edition of the magazine in an interview released on Tuesday.",politicsNews,"December 7, 2016 ",1

It turns out that the baby dolphin died because the people on the beach kept out of the water too long.Here is the photo taken by one a person on the beach:https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209159500094765&set=a.10201500166576214.1073741829.1537837065&type=3&theaterHere is video footage of the incident:The Wildlife Foundation in Argentina found photos and video of the tourists tormenting the dolphin. They took the opportunity to try to raise awareness about the type of dolphin and what people need to do when they find a dolphin on the beach. They write in a press release: [The]Franciscan or Plata dolphin is one of the smallest dolphins in the world, is between 1.30 and 1.70 m long. His skin, brown tones, reminiscent of the habit of the Franciscan monks, so it gets the common name. Only it is found in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.

This incident should help the public understand the urgent need to return these dolphins to the sea when they get close to the shore,  the foundation said.  The Franciscana, like other species, cannot remain for much time outside of the water, it has thick skin full of fat which regulates its body temperature, so taking it out of the water rapidly causes it to dehydrate and die. What those people did is absolutely horrendous. Hopefully, this tragedy will raise awareness about what people should do when they encounter beached marine life.

17723,One of Liberia's main parties calls for halt to election results,"One of Liberia s leading political parties called for a halt in announcing the result of Tuesday s presidential election, citing irregularities in the vote.  The Liberty Party, whose candidate Charles Brumskine was considered a front-runner to take over from Nobel Peace Prize winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, said it would consider taking legal action if the National Elections Commission (NEC) did not act on its demands. The NEC was originally expected to release preliminary results on Thursday.   The Liberty Party is deeply troubled by the discovery of numerous incidents of irregularities and fraud that occurred during the elections,  Liberty Party national chairman Benjamin Sanvee said in a statement.   We are calling on NEC to immediately halt further announcements of election results. If NEC does not cooperate with our request, we will take the appropriate legal action,  he said. He did not give specific evidence of voter fraud and it was unclear what kind of activity could have altered Tuesday s vote.  An NEC spokesman told Reuters that it was unaware of the Liberty Party s complaint and did not say whether the commission believed illegal acts occurred.  On election day, materials including ballot boxes arrived late in some locations and some people struggled to find their names on voter rolls, witnesses said, but there was so far no evidence that this was linked to illicit activity.

12641,BREAKING: HILLARY CAMPAIGN Planned Fake “GRASSROOTS” Millennial Movement To Steal Bernie Followers,"Wikileaks released another email showing how phony Hillary s campaign has been from the start. Americans should never believe the polls. Hillary has NEVER given Americans a reason to want to get behind her. Its why she and her camp, with the help of the media are constantly manufacturing what appears to be (but really is not) support for her candidacy. The most HILL-larious part of this whole story is that Hillary s camp planned to use the young Tallahassee Mayor, Andrew Gillum to launch Hillary s fake  grassroots  group after he gave a speech at the DNC about how  trust  in government  can be restored! Here is the attachment to an email addressed to Hillary s campaign manager, John Podesta:CONCEPT PAPEROBJECTIVE:Mobilize young voter participation for the 2016 election in support of Hillary ClintonSTRATEGY: Use young elected officials and entertainers to build a  grassroots  movement of under 40 voters as a vehicle to migrate support for Bernie into activism for Hillary.OPERATIONAL GOALS: Identify young elected officials (YEOs)across the country to become the face of a new organization that is focused on a progressive future. These young elected officials would promote both the organization, the ideas embraced by it and the need for civic engagement with an immediate focus on involvement in the 2016 election. They would be seen as the faces of a new progressivist movement that combines noble goals with political realities resulting in real progress.The organization would be built around a group of ideas or concepts as opposed to parties or individuals. The ideas should always reinforce the message that the under 40 generation needs to engage politically to shape their own future. Building the New Economy, Creating an Empowerment Society, Transitioning to a Sustainable World, Tearing Down Barriers are all phrases which might be included in the messaging. Support for the Hillary would be included in the messaging but initially as tangential to it, i.e.  if you support these things then there really isn t another choice but her . Over time the messaging would transition more into the actionable item of involvement in the campaign and support for its efforts.The organization should be built around a Ready for Hillary type model: grassroots driven, limited engagement of the principal, both an organizational and small dollar fundraising component, centered on-line and in venues frequented by under 40 s   college campuses, with a big emphasis on community colleges, nightclubs, athletic events, etc.The group should be branded separately from the campaign so people who engage with it feel like they created and own it as opposed to feeling swallowed by an organization that defeated them. A distinct name, artwork, website, spokespeople etc would be desired.TACTICS:The program should be launched initially in one state and then expand out. It should be seen as growing and spreading. We want people calling and asking if they can set one up in their state as opposed to forcing the model on them.The YEO s in that state would announce the formation of their group stating theirs goal to help elect a progressive President and engage young people with a goal of making sure their voices are heard and they are ready to participate. It should feel almost like  we got together and decided to do this on our own . Depending on the organizational model, they could say they all support Hillary and are doing it to help but there are bigger and longer term objectives here, etc. Ideally you could say something like the campaign is providing limited resources but has agreed any funds you raise will be directed into youth outreach.They would then do a series of event which would be a college campus  town hall  during the day and a club type event that night. The  town hall  with students would be informal with talking with students about goals, dreams, political reality, how government can make things happen, how sometimes it doesn t, etc. It would end in a pitch for them to become engaged politically to build a progressive future. Later in the evening, these YEO s would attend and speak briefly at a campaign event in a bar/club featuring a local DJ or entertainer and has a nominal contribution as part of attendence. The campus event will be used to build buzz for the second event as well as the campaign itself. As momentum grows for the organization, bigger names would be brought in for the  town hall  events as well as bigger artists for the  club  events, furthering the momentum. Eventually, HRC/WJC/CVC as well as VP and Spouse would be integrated into these events but it should be seen as them coming to the  movement  as opposed to them trying to take it over.RECOMMENDATIONS:This program be launched by Mayor Andre Gillum in Florida. Goal would be early AprilTarget is to have 10 people at launchDo events in Miami, Palm Beach, Gainesville, Jacksonville, Tampa and Orlando in April.Convene a group of National YEO s in May/June to discuss their involvement.Have organization functioning in 5 battlegound states by June 1   Florida, Colorado, Virginia, North Carolina?",politics,"Oct 24, 2016",1
161,Do not expect postcard-sized tax return from Republican plan: experts,"Since mid-2016, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has carried around a “postcard” that he has said shows how easy it will be for Americans to file their taxes once Republicans are finished their tax overhaul. And as recently as Thursday President Donald Trump touted Americans being able to “file their taxes on a single, little beautiful sheet of paper.”     With lawmakers finalizing the biggest tax reform in 30 years and the president ready to sign it into law before the end of the year, the moment should be near when Ryan’s postcard stops being a rhetorical prop and becomes a reality. Right? “It’s kind of crazy to say you can file on a postcard when, first, no one is going to put their Social Security number on a postcard. And second, you already have a giant postcard in the form of the 1040EZ,” Mark Mazur, a director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said, citing a 14-line Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax form. Representatives from the $11 billion U.S. tax preparation industry said that the legislation so far seemed unlikely to render their services unnecessary. “I don’t think you’re going to have millions of people filing their taxes on a cell phone,” said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc [JAKHT.UL]. “I think the demise of the tax business is a bit premature.” The IRS would not discuss changes that might come from the proposed tax overhaul. However, the IRS estimates that, despite its efforts to make filing taxes easier, 90 percent of Americans use tax preparation services such as Jackson Hewitt, H&R Block Inc and Liberty Tax Inc or tax software such as TurboTax from Intuit Inc.     If Congress enacts the Republican plan into law, it would not affect 2017 tax-year returns filed in 2018. But in 2019,  millions of middle-class Americans would no longer gain from a wide range of deductions, credits and other tax breaks. A key driver of this, according to independent analyses, would be a proposed doubling of the standard deduction and a curtailment of the deduction for state and local tax payments. In combination, these two changes would mean that about 29 million people would no longer benefit from itemizing. So they would stop writing off their charitable donations, mortgage interest and state and local tax payments, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a think tank. Itemized deductions for medical expenses, investment interest, unreimbursed employee expenses and tax preparation fees could also be dropped by many.  Personal exemptions for individual taxpayers, which now take up a lot of space on tax forms, would also be eliminated.  Such changes would mean simpler taxes and possibly allow a number of taxpayers to use shorter forms. The IRS expects 24 million people in 2018 to file the longest and most widely used IRS form today, the Form 1040, which is 79 lines long. About 4.6 million people will use the 14-line 1040EZ. Wealthy Americans likely would still itemize under the Republican plan. Owning businesses, homes and other factors could also lead to taxes being more complicated than what filers could describe on a postcard. “Even though we’re talking about simplification for a large number of taxpayers, there’s still many taxpayers who will have complicated tax situations and we’ll be there to help them as well,” said David Williams, chief tax officer for TurboTax.

7065,"More company climate votes ahead, as Trump may loosen energy rules","Activist shareholders plan a record number of resolutions focused on climate change at U.S. company annual meetings in 2017, even as President-elect Donald Trump looks set to loosen environmental regulations. Based on filings so far, U.S. companies are on track to face roughly 200 resolutions on climate matters at their shareholder meetings next year, according to Rob Berridge, who follows the subject for Ceres, a sustainability advocacy group.  There were 174 such resolutions this year, Berridge said, compared with 167 in 2015 and 148 in 2014. Many have been directed at big oil and gas companies, though other sectors have also been targeted, including technology and retail. Activist shareholders broadly aim to curb companies’ carbon emissions and make energy usage more efficient, or at the very least, to draw the attention of companies and investors to climate change as an urgent problem.  They have had some limited success. Investors at Exxon Mobil Corp the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer, passed a measure this year that could lead to an environmental activist joining its board. “Our position is that the risk of climate change is clear and warrants action,” said Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers. The rising number of shareholder votes reflects a growing concern among big investors about the environment, encouraged by steps by some boards to embrace reforms.  Deadlines are fast approaching to get resolutions on the ballot for shareholder meetings to be held in the spring. The election victory of Trump, who is set to take over as U.S. president on Jan. 20, only seems to have added impetus.  On the campaign trail, Trump dismissed human-caused climate change as a “hoax” and pledged to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency. He also threatened to withdraw the United States from the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change, although he appeared to step back from that position on Tuesday. He vowed instead to revive the U.S. coal industry, encourage oil drilling and to scale back regulation of the energy sector.  “Despite what the administration may or may not do, I really believe that corporations understand the risks posed by climate change,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a  California nonprofit campaign group. It sponsored 18 climate-related shareholder resolutions in 2016 and expects to file a bigger number next year. One resolution for 2017 calls on Anadarko Petroleum Corp to report on how it would address the risk of so-called stranded assets, such as high-cost deepwater project investments, that might be caused by a drop in demand for oil and gas. The idea won support from 42 percent of shares voted at the company’s 2016 meeting, up from 29 percent in 2015. Anadarko’s board last year called the idea “unnecessary and unproductive.” Spokesman John Christiansen said it is reviewing the proposal. To be sure, among S&P 500 companies, investor support for climate resolutions has been relatively weak, holding steady around 22 percent since 2014, according to research firm Fund Votes.  But activists often won more backing for ideas such as urging companies to report on their strategy for dealing with climate change, according to the Sustainable Investments Institute, a research firm specializing in shareholder votes, supported by universities, pension funds and other institutional investors.  Anne Simpson, director of sustainability for the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (Calpers), which manages about $300 billion, said it plans to file or back resolutions at U.S. oil and gas companies for 2017, though she declined to discuss specifics.  Last year the boards of mining companies including Rio Tinto Plc and Glencore Plc endorsed resolutions Calpers submitted calling for reports on climate risk, and the measures passed by wide margins.  More companies will likely embrace shareholder proposals to head off disruption caused by climate change, Simpson said. “Economics is driving this, not politics,” she said.",politicsNews,"November 25, 2016 ",1

21028,Anti-Uber protests disrupt major Chilean airport; one dead,"Taxi drivers protesting the growth of mobile ride hailing applications such as Uber and Cabify blocked the main road to Chile s principal airport in capital Santiago on Monday, leading to one death and wreaking havoc on travelers  plans. Santiago-based LATAM Airlines, the region s biggest carrier, as well as budget carrier Sky suffered delays, local media reported. Television images showed traffic backed up for miles (kilometers), while many passengers resorted to walking along the highway. One 65-year-old Brazilian tourist stuck in traffic died of a cardiovascular event, Chilean police said without offering any further details. A medical helicopter evacuated the man, but it was too late, they added.   This takeover of the airport by the taxi drivers has significantly hurt the image of Chile, the image of the airlines, and has hurt people traveling or arriving in the country,  Claudio Orrego, the governor of the Santiago Metropolitan Region, told reporters. He added that the government would bring charges against those responsible for the protests, and that at least 15 people had already been arrested. Legislation is advancing slowly through Chile s Congress to regulate Uber and Cabify, which remain in a legal gray zone. While some authorities have promised to sanction users of the widely used applications, they have also expressed a desire to bring the services within Chile s existing regulatory framework.",worldnews,"September 4, 2017 ",0
20744,Florida residents heed Irma warnings after Harvey's destruction,"Hurricane Harvey s destruction in Texas may not have altered Florida s well-tested storm plans, but it appears to have infused residents with a new sense of urgency as they prepare for approaching Hurricane Irma. Officials said Harvey s devastating flooding, coupled with the sheer power of Irma, ranked as the strongest Atlantic storm on record, had sharpened the focus of Floridians who were somewhat indifferent about preparing for past hurricanes.  A lot of times they end up having hurricane parties here instead of evacuating,  Monroe County spokeswoman Cammy Clark said by phone.  That s been the opposite this time around.  Monroe County includes the Florida Keys, which ordered evacuations for all residents and tourists. Clark said she saw a steady stream of traffic leaving the travel destination as she drove to work early on Wednesday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasts that Irma may strike southern Florida on Saturday, when it could still be a major hurricane.  As it neared Puerto Rico on Wednesday with maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour (295 kph), Irma was a Category 5 storm, the highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity.  This storm is bigger, faster and stronger than Hurricane Andrew,  Florida Governor Rick Scott told a news conference on Wednesday, referring to one of the costliest storms in U.S. history that struck southern Miami-Dade County 25 years ago. For south Florida, Hurricane Irma  is a once-in-a-generation storm. It s the Big One for us,  Ed Rappaport, acting director of the hurricane center, told WFOR-TV in Miami on Wednesday evening.  Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez on Wednesday evening announced mandatory evacuations for most of the county s coastal cities beginning at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) on Thursday. Miami-Dade has a population of 2.7 million. The evacuation orders affect more than 100,000 residents, the Miami Herald reported. Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine had already urged residents of that city on Tuesday to evacuate.  We don t want any heroes,  he said.  We want people to bring themselves to a safer place than a barrier island.  Officials across Florida said they saw signs of people taking Irma more seriously than past storms.  Residents were stocking up on water and batteries and even complaining that county leaders were not being quick enough to announce evacuations, said Don Walker, spokesman for Brevard County Emergency Management. Houston officials were criticized for not ordering an evacuation ahead of the flooding that left hundreds of people in the country s fourth-largest city trapped in their homes.  Everyone is really in tune with this storm system. My neighbors are talking about it, and we don t usually do that,  Walker said. For years, many Florida residents, joined by an ever-growing number of newcomers, paid little heed to hurricane warnings as most opted to stay in their homes, county officials said. Not this time around.  I ll tell you for the community, heck yeah, they re taking this more seriously,  said Teri Barbera, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff s Office, noting that many stores were out of bottled water by Monday.

3036,Top Democrat slams Obama administration's response to Russian hacks,"The top Democrat on the U.S. House Intelligence Committee on Sunday criticized the administration of former President Barack Obama for not taking earlier and tougher action against Russia for its alleged hacks aimed at swaying the Nov. 8 election for Donald Trump. “The Obama administration should have done a lot more when it became clear that not only was Russia intervening, but it was being directed at the highest levels of the Kremlin,” said Representative Adam Schiff on CNN’s “State of the Union” program. The Obama administration imposed sanctions in December on two Russian intelligence agencies over their alleged involvement in hacking political groups during the election, but those sanctions were too little, too late, Schiff said. Schiff and his Senate counterpart, Dianne Feinstein, issued an unusual public statement in September condemning Russia for the alleged hacks. “We had to vet that with the intelligence community, but we took that step because we weren’t succeeding in getting the administration to do it itself,” Schiff said.",politicsNews,"June 25, 2017 ",1
6420,Russia hacked Republican state campaigns but not Trump's: FBI head,"Russia hacked into Republican state political campaigns and old email domains of the Republican National Committee but there is no evidence it successfully penetrated President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign, FBI Director James Comey said on Tuesday. Comey also told lawmakers Russia did not release information obtained from the state campaigns or the old RNC email domains, comments that may buttress the U.S. intelligence view that Moscow tried to help Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies on Friday released an assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a covert effort to help Republican Trump’s electoral chances by discrediting Clinton.      The report, which omitted classified details, was the U.S. government’s starkest public description of what it says was a Russian effort to manipulate the American electoral process by leaking hacked emails from Democrats. Russia has denied interfering in the election but President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian suspected spies from the United States and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies last month in response to the allegations. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told a news conference on Tuesday those penalties were “a start and not the end” of U.S. retaliation for the hacks, and senior officials have suggested covert action may be taken. Comey told lawmakers the Federal Bureau of Investigation  “did not develop any evidence that the Trump campaign, or the current RNC, was successfully hacked.” He did not say whether Russia had tried to hack Trump’s campaign.        Trump has disputed the accusations of Russian cyber attacks during the election, but his incoming chief of staff said on Sunday that the New York businessman accepts the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusions that Russia was responsible, and that further action may be taken against Moscow. Comey declined to comment on whether or not the FBI might be investigating links between Russia and associates of Trump, who frequently called during the campaign for improved relations between Washington and Moscow.  The FBI director was pressed by Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, to publicly provide a declassified answer to the question before Jan. 20, the day Trump will be inaugurated, but Comey suggested he would unable to do so.             Comey appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee along with the director of national intelligence, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency and the chief of the National Security Agency at a time of controversy in Washington about the 2016 election. Testifying before Congress for the first time since Trump beat Clinton on Nov. 8, Comey has been criticized by Democrats for statements about a separate investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state. The controversy over Russia’s alleged role in attempting to influence the election has roiled Washington, with Democratic lawmakers calling for an independent commission to investigate the matter and Republicans worried that the affair might call into question the legitimacy of Trump’s victory. Comey said there was evidence Russia hacked Republican state-level political campaigns and “old” email domains that the RNC was no longer using. In contrast, Friday’s report assessed that Russian military intelligence used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and the Guccifer 2.0 “persona” to release emails that it had acquired from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats as part of the effort to help Trump and harm Clinton.     The DNC denied “multiple requests” made by the FBI to examine its hacked servers, Comey said. He added that his agents relied on a forensic analysis conducted by the cyber security firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC to help clean up the hack when it was detected last spring.    Senior U.S. Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Tuesday seeking to impose a wide range of sanctions on Russia over its cyber activities and actions in Syria and Ukraine.",politicsNews,"January 10, 2017 ",0

10609,Sanders supporters' courtship of Clinton superdelegates may be backfiring,"Backers of Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders have launched a campaign to win over some of his rival Hillary Clinton’s most prized supporters - the superdelegates that can make the difference in a tight race for the party’s nomination. But some emails, phone messages, and petitions sent by the Sanders boosters have backfired, upsetting superdelegates with their aggressive tone and leading many to dig in their heels for Clinton, according to interviews conducted by Reuters. The drive to flip Clinton’s super delegates has not been sanctioned by Sanders’ campaign, his spokesman Michael Briggs said. “Bernie’s campaign is focused on reaching out to all voters and earning delegates at primaries and caucuses,” he said in a statement, stressing that the Sanders campaign was not coordinating with supporters to contact superdelegates.  However, the unofficial push could complicate the U.S. Senator from Vermont’s efforts to woo the critical bloc in the coming months.  The effort has at times taken an angry tone, some of the messages reviewed by Reuters showed, reflecting the anti-establishment tinge of the 2016 presidential race where many voters are unhappy with Washington insiders. Some 85 percent of the 4,763 delegate votes to the Democratic National Convention that will decide who will face a Republican rival in the November election are determined by the results of states’ nominating contests. But the remaining 15 percent are held by superdelegates, who get to vote however they like - meaning they could hold the key to a tight contest. Superdelegates are made up of party leaders and elected Senators, members of Congress, and governors. The Democratic party adopted the system in the early 1980s as a way of giving party leaders more control over the nominating process, though they have yet to play a decisive role in a nomination. “The idea there is that you’ve got people who have a long view ... who have, arguably, the best interests of the party at heart,” said Terri Fine, a professor of political science at the University of Central Florida.  At least one superdelegate who has backed Sanders, however, finds the system that can overturn the will of regular voters flawed. “I’m a superdelegate to fight to end superdelegates,” said Larry Cohen, a former president of the Communications Workers of America union who volunteers full-time for the Sanders campaign.  Among super delegates that have tipped their hand so far, Clinton holds 453 to 20 for Sanders, according to the New York Times delegate tracker. Among regular delegates, won through nominating contests, Clinton leads by 91 to 65 after the South Carolina primary. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1QHZCSj ) The Republican party does reserve slots for members of its national leadership, but they do not have such influence as Democratic superdelegates. Interviews with 10 of the 505 super delegates supporting Clinton Reuters has reached show that nine of them have been approached by people purporting to back Sanders, and nearly all were displeased by the tone of the outreach.  Isabel Framer of Ohio, a superdelegate for Clinton, for example, got a voice mail last week urging her to vote for Sanders “in accordance with the will of the people.”  On the voice mail, heard by Reuters, the anonymous male caller says: “I think it’s crap that you get to vote whichever way you want... I’ll be watching your vote.”  “I’m not easily frightened,” Framer told Reuters. “I’m not going to change a vote over threats.”  Akilah Ensley, a North Carolina superdelegate, said she started hearing more often from Sanders supporters after her name appeared on a Wikipedia list noting her support for Clinton. “Some of them were nice, and some were rather abrasive,” she said, adding “attacking my decisions is probably not the best way” to change her mind.  Luis Heredia, an Arizona superdelegate for Clinton, said he has received over 30 phone calls, emails and instant messages from Sanders supporters. “The majority of them are more angry, and the tone is more demanding,” Heredia said.  Lacy Johnson, an Indiana superdelegate backing Clinton, meanwhile, said he had received a mix of messages, including one that he said threatened: “we will make you pay.” Andres Ramirez, a political consultant in Las Vegas, Nevada, and a superdelegate supporting Clinton, said in the past campaigns would typically try to soft-sell their candidates rather than use pressure tactics. “The way this has gone down, in my experience, has never happened before,” said. While it is unclear who is directing some of the calls and emails to Clinton’s superdelegates, Seattle resident Justin Renquist has pushed for some of the outreach, although he stressed that such contacts needed to be civil. Renquist calls  himself part of the “Superdelegate Task Force Army” that rallies Sanders supporters to reach superdelegates via Facebook, Twitter and other means. “There are 3,000 in my group who have been slamming these guys as politely and nicely as we can...basically saying, look this system is undemocratic,” Renquist said.  On Friday, the group issued a statement saying it did not support, condone or engage in any communication with superdelegages that was “vulgar, threatening, harassing or intimidating.” Other Sanders fans, meanwhile, have gathered more than 300,000 signatures under at least two petitions on MoveOn.org, asking superdelegates to vote in line with the results of the primaries and caucuses.  A third petition, on the Democracy for America site, also asks superdelegates to follow state nominating contests. It was started by Robert Reich, who was a secretary of labor under Bill Clinton and who has endorsed Sanders. The Sanders campaign plans its own effort to win over superdelegates, possibly in April.  “That’s when we’ll make a much stronger approach to superdelegates,” said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign.  Clinton’s campaign, meanwhile, started officially courting superdelegates months ago. “We are proud to have the support of these Democratic party leaders, who have been in the trenches,” said Jesse Ferguson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign.

12644,Israel defence minister says hopes Palestinian protests waning,"Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Sunday he hoped the violence that erupted in Palestinian protests against President Donald Trump s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel s capital was abating.  Our hope is that everything is calming down and that we are returning to a path of normal life without riots and without violence,  Lieberman told Army Radio. Violence erupted for a third day on Saturday in Gaza and the occupied West Bank in response to Trump s announcement on Wednesday in which he overturned decades of U.S. policy towards the Middle East.  Pre-dawn Israeli air strikes on Saturday killed two Palestinian gunmen after militants fired rockets from the enclave into Israel on Friday.  However, street protests in Gaza and the West Bank were less intense on Saturday than on the previous two days and the military said there were no rocket launchings on Saturday night. Trump s recognition of Jerusalem has infuriated the Arab world and upset Western allies, who say it is a blow to peace efforts and risks causing further unrest in the Middle East. Late on Saturday, Arab foreign ministers urged the United States to abandon its decision and said the move would spur violence throughout the region. Israel says that all of Jerusalem is its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state. Most countries consider East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after capturing it in a 1967 war, to be occupied territory, and say the status of the city should be left to be decided at future Israeli-Palestinian talks. The Trump administration says it is still committed to Palestinian-Israeli talks, that Israel s capital would be in Jerusalem under any serious peace plan, and that it has not taken a position on the city s borders.

At the outset of a congressional hearing on tax reform, Senator Orrin Hatch said the Senate Finance Committee he chairs would not be a rubber stamp for the other congressional Republican leaders and senior aides to President Donald Trump who make up the select group that has been working on a tax reform framework for months. The Big Six is preparing to release its framework on Sept. 25, a release that will sound the starting gun for Hatch’s panel and the House Ways and Means Committee to produce tax reform legislation that is now expected in October. Overhauling the U.S. tax code is a top priority of Trump and congressional Republicans, who campaigned on it last year. They have made little progress since taking power in Washington in January via a closed-door process that has excluded Democrats. “The group – some have deemed us the Big Six – will not dictate the direction we take in this committee,” Hatch said. “The Finance Committee will not be bound by any previous tax reform proposal or framework when we start putting our bill together.” Some analysts viewed the Utah Republican’s comments as the beginning of what could be a widening rift among Republicans in the Senate, House and White House that could jeopardize hopes of completing the first overhaul of the tax code in 31 years before January. “Disagreements over both substance and process are driving a wedge between senior House Republicans involved in the tax-writing process and their Senate counterparts,” Henrietta Treyz of investment advisory firm Veda Partners said in a report.  But House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, Hatch’s congressional counterpart, described potential divergence as a natural and even healthy development that would be kept in check by common ground on major tax issues. “We’ll work this out by the end of the year,” Brady told reporters. “At the end of the day, we just have to sit down and find common ground.” Hatch and Brady are among the Big Six, which also includes Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn. There have already been two statements of general tax principles from Republicans: a one-page document from the Trump administration in April and a joint statement from the Big Six negotiators in July. Democrats have criticized Republican plans as too favorable to the wealthiest Americans and corporations. With the latest blueprint due in less than two weeks, Brady and Mnuchin appeared to differ on Thursday over how much detail the document would contain. Brady told a policy forum that he did not expect the document to offer specifics on tax rates, while Mnuchin said the plan would contain extensive details including a specific corporate rate. Brady later told reporters that talks continued over what the document would contain.     “It is still clearly possible that tax reform could be enacted over the next near. However, the signs are not particularly positive at the moment,” analyst Jan Hatzius of investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a research note on Thursday. After months of talks, basic questions on the Republican tax plan remain unanswered, such as whether or not the tax cuts they want will expand the U.S. budget deficit. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday that the tax reform plan would be revenue neutral, if economic growth spurred by the legislation is taken into account. Revenue neutrality is fast emerging as a divisive issue in Congress, where deficit hawks have expressed misgivings about adding to the deficit.  In White House meetings with top Democrats in recent days, Trump has shown a new willingness to deal with the opposition.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi talked about tax reform with Trump after their Wednesday discussion on immigration, according to Representative Richard Neal, the top Ways and Means Democrat. Neal said the White House appeared to be “in synch” with Democrats for now on tax relief for the middle class. “I think that there could be some room there for conversation,” he told the same policy forum where Brady spoke.",politicsNews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
4298,Trump spokesman sparks outcry by comparing Assad to Hitler,"White House spokesman Sean Spicer triggered an uproar on Tuesday by saying Adolf Hitler did not use chemical weapons. He apologized after his comments drew immediate criticism on social media and elsewhere for overlooking the fact that millions of Jews were killed in Nazi gas chambers. Spicer made the assertion at a daily news briefing, during a discussion about the April 4 chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed 87 people. Washington has blamed the attack on the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. “You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons,” Spicer said when asked about Russia’s alliance with the Syrian government. The Nazis murdered six million Jews during World War Two. Many Jews as well as others were killed in gas chambers in European concentration camps. When a reporter asked Spicer if he wanted to clarify his comments, he said: “I think when you come to sarin gas, there was no, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing.” Later on Tuesday, Spicer apologized and said he should not have made that comparison. “It was a mistake. I shouldn’t have done it and I won’t do it again,” Spicer told CNN in an interview. “It was inappropriate and insensitive.” Spicer’s assertion, made during the Jewish holiday of Passover, sparked instant outrage on social media and from some Holocaust memorial groups who accused him of minimizing Hitler’s crimes.  “Sean Spicer now lacks the integrity to serve as White House press secretary, and President Trump must fire him at once,” said Steven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect. Shortly after the White House briefing, Spicer emailed a statement to reporters in response to their queries, but had stopped short of offering an explicit apology.  “In no way was I trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust. I was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers. Any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable,” Spicer said in the statement. The U.S. Holocaust Museum did not mention Spicer’s comments directly, but sent out a tweet shortly after the briefing that showed graphic footage of dead bodies U.S. forces found while liberating the Buchenwald concentration camp. The video was retweeted more than a thousand times, with many Twitter users referencing Spicer’s comments. U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called on Republican President Donald Trump to reject Spicer’s assertion. “Sean Spicer must be fired, and the President must immediately disavow his spokesman’s statements,” Pelosi said in a statement. The White House did not immediately respond when asked to comment on Pelosi’s statement. It was not the first time the White House has had to answer questions about the Holocaust. Critics in January noted the administration’s statement marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which omitted any mention of Jewish victims. At the time, Spicer defended that statement by saying it had been written in part by a Jewish staff member whose family members had survived the Holocaust.",politicsNews,"April 11, 2017 ",0

A La Salle University student told Philly Mag that she only found out about the warning because she saw a safety advisory on the university s website, but no one was sent a text or an email warning. Philly Mag stated that the FBI hadn t responded to a request for a comment.Via: Heavy",Government News,"Oct 4, 2015",1
2927,"Trump to Senate Republicans: kill Obamacare now, replace later","U.S. President Donald Trump urged Republican senators in a tweet on Friday to repeal Obamacare immediately if they cannot agree on a new plan to replace it, muddying the waters as congressional leaders struggle for consensus on healthcare legislation. Senate Republican leaders had set Friday as the target for rewriting legislation for a simultaneous repeal and replacement of extensive parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the law dubbed Obamacare that expanded health insurance coverage to 20 million people. The deadline seemed unlikely to be met given that most senators had left Washington ahead of next week’s recess, without agreement on a clear direction for the healthcare bill, and Trump’s tweet did not appear to gain political traction. Financial markets showed little reaction to Trump’s suggestion, with the benchmark S&P 500 index edging about 0.15 percent higher on the day. Shares of most health insurers gained fractionally while hospital stocks were little changed. Trump wrote on Twitter Friday morning, “If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!”  The White House said later that Trump was still “fully committed” to pushing the Republican draft healthcare bill through the Senate, although it was looking at every option for repealing and replacing Obamacare. “The president hasn’t changed his thinking at all,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. The current Senate legislation would repeal parts of Obamacare, roll back its expansion of the Medicaid government healthcare program for the poor, eliminate most of Obamacare’s taxes and replace Obamacare insurance subsidies with a system of tax credits to help individuals buy private health insurance. Conservative and moderate Republicans have spent recent days pushing and pulling the bill in opposite directions as Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell sought common ground. Moderates want more equity for low-income Americans, while conservatives are fighting to loosen insurance regulations. Shortly before his January inauguration, Trump urged lawmakers to repeal and replace Obamacare at the same time.  Congressional Republicans had considered earlier this year first repealing, then replacing Obamacare, but backed away after some lawmakers protested that that approach could create a gap in insurance coverage for millions. On Friday, Republican Senator Ben Sasse who had suggested that Congress first repeal Obamacare and then replace it, tweeted: “Glad you agree, Mr. Pres.” Conservative Senator Rand Paul also backed the idea. But others on Capitol Hill sounded annoyed. A senior Senate Republican aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that if lawmakers had been able to get the votes for repealing Obamacare first, then replacing it, “senators would have done that in January. It doesn’t have the votes, and it’s a waste of valuable time to discuss it.” Annie Clark, a spokeswoman for moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins, said the lawmaker would not support the strategy. McConnell’s spokesman declined to comment on Trump’s tweet.    A senior House of Representatives Republican, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, said in an interview for CSPAN’s “Newsmakers” program that lawmakers’ goal should continue to be “not simply repealing but to start to put into place the elements that can make healthcare affordable.”",politicsNews,"June 30, 2017 ",0

7354,Trump's foreign policy approach almost same as that of Putin: Kremlin,"The Kremlin said on Thursday U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s foreign policy approach was “phenomenally close” to that of President Vladimir Putin, giving Russia hope that tattered U.S.-Russia relations could gradually be improved. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, speaking in New York, said he saw incredible similarities between the two men’s foreign policy ideas, and this meant there was a solid basis to start a meaningful dialogue between Moscow and Washington.          Peskov, in the United States for a chess tournament, said he was struck by how similar parts of Trump’s victory speech were to a speech Putin gave in southern Russia last month.  Both men said they would put their own country’s national interests first, but that they would be ready to develop ties with other nations, depending on how ready other countries were to deepen relations themselves. “They (Putin and Trump) set out the same main foreign policy principles and that is incredible,” Peskov said in comments broadcast by Russian state TV’s Channel One on Thursday evening. “It is phenomenal how close they are to one another when it comes to their conceptual approach to foreign policy. And that is probably a good basis for our moderate optimism that they will at least be able to start a dialogue to start to clear out the Augean stables in our bilateral relations.”  With Moscow and Washington now at odds over Syria, Ukraine and NATO, Peskov cautioned that it would take a long time before relations could return to a high level, however, because of how far they had been allowed to deteriorate. “An atmosphere of mutual trust takes years to achieve,” he said. “It’s not possible to just declare that there is an atmosphere of mutual trust, especially after such serious damage was done in the last few years to our relations.” Peskov told the TASS news agency separately that Putin was ready to be flexible when it came to mending ties which he wanted to improve, but that there was a limit to his flexibility and that he would need to see some U.S. reciprocity. Peskov spoke after one of Russia’s most senior diplomats told the Interfax news agency earlier on Thursday that the Russian government had been in touch with members of Trump’s political team during the U.S. election campaign and knew most of his entourage.",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",0
7173,New Study Shows Why Major Insurers Hate The ACA – It Actually Forces Them To Help Sick People,"Major insurers everywhere have dumped massive cash into lobbying against the ACA. Their corporate-owned Republicans have insisted it would destroy America in any number of strange and unusual ways. Now a new study reveals why they say helping sick people afford to see a doctor is bad for the country.Data has become available for 2014 and 2015 enrollees to Blue Cross and Blue Shield, who were picked up through the Affordable Care Act s health insurance exchanges. It shows that the people who the ACA was specifically created to help are actually going to the doctor and using medical services. Huge shock, right? The entirety of the Republican and corporate establishment s opposition to the ACA resides in a single thing   money. More for them, and none for regular people. If the poor and middle class suffer and die needlessly, that s just their cost of doing business.People who got back into the insurance market, thanks to the ACA, were shown to have a 22 percent higher medical cost than those with employer-based coverage in 2015. The average monthly spending numbers for the new enrollees was $559 in 2015 compared to $457 for group members who had it through an employer. The same new enrollee segment increased from $501 in 2014 to the previously mentioned $559 in 2015.The irony of the situation is that the very corporations who are whining about having to pay the bills of sick people were the primary engineers of their own self-imposed disaster. These are the same corporations that spiked health insurance costs, causing people to be unable to afford it. They are also the same corporations that outright refused to sell people coverage, because of  pre-existing conditions.  Pre-existing conditions that could be literally anything they wanted them to be. After sometimes decades of unmanaged health issues, these new enrollees are consuming services at elevated rates. Insurers basically screwed themselves for short-term profits, and now they have to pay some of it back. Pardon me if I am less than sympathetic towards them.This shows just how desperately needed the ACA is, and how incredibly dishonest health insurers are about their business model. The fact insurance payouts rose as much as they did in as short a time is proof just how many Americans were suffering without need. That is where the darker truth of the health insurance industry comes into plain view. These companies are still wildly profitable. They just want to keep more money for themselves. Simply put, they ve become a caricature of their own greedy reputations.The tragedy of this all is that the same data showing how desperately needed the ACA is, also is being used as misinformation to completely lie to America about how bad it is for the country. The only tidbit being presented is that it is increasing costs to insurance companies, which does mean their premiums might go up. However, the overall increase in premiums is at a slower rate than before Obamacare became law, even with the increased payouts for more consumption of services.Right wingers and unscrupulous insurance companies are taking the very truth about why it is a good law, and perverting it into a lie about how it is bad by purposefully omitting all context until the  truth  is whatever they want it to be. If you add in the fact that initial expenditures are going to be higher until we catch up with decades of a lack of care, you can argue a case that premiums would have actually dropped if all other things were equal, due to massive amounts of new customers spreading out the cost burden.As more new data becomes available, and initial over-consumption tapers off, the last arguments to be made against the law will ultimately boil down to profit over people. If anything will prove how obsolete the American health insurance industry is, and why single-payer is needed, that will be it.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty",News,"April 1, 2016",1

20688,Hurricane Irma worsens Latin America's fuel supply crunch,"Monster Hurricane Irma has shut down oil terminals across the northern Caribbean, worsening a fuel supply crunch in Latin America which is struggling to meet demand since Hurricane Harvey disrupted shipments from the U.S. Gulf Coast last month. Latin America had been scrambling for almost two weeks to find oil cargoes because of Harvey, which caused massive flooding in Texas and Louisiana, shutting down ports, refineries and production platforms. Irma, which is being followed by two hurricanes in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, was affecting Caribbean refineries, terminals and storage facilities. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Irma is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean and one of the five most forceful storms to hit the Atlantic basin in 82 years. The Caribbean has the capacity to store more than 100 million barrels, which is crucial for those nations because of limited ability to refine crude, and also as supply for South American nations including Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia.  Several oil trading firms had moved a portion of their U.S. fuel inventories to the Caribbean ahead of Harvey so they could keep selling cargoes to Latin America, traders from two companies told Reuters.  Those barrels are now locked in terminals in St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as Irma, a Category 5 storm with winds of 185 mph (295 kph), was expected to hammer the region for several more days as it moves west-northwest.   Irma is arriving at a bad moment. Not all oil storage facilities in the Caribbean have closed, but vessel traffic is difficult in the middle of the storm. It will get worse before getting any better,  said a trader from an oil firm that rents tanks in St. Croix. Buckeye Partners LP (BPL.N), the largest owner of oil storage facilities in the Caribbean with 41.1 million barrels of capacity, shut its Puerto Rico terminal on Wednesday. It also plans to close BORCO, its largest terminal in the Bahamas that can store up to 26.2 million barrels, by the end of the day on Thursday, a source familiar with terminal operations said. Also in the Bahamas, Statoil s (STL.OL) South Riding Point terminal was open on Thursday, the company said. But traders added that plans to halt marine operations would likely start later on Thursday.  NuStar Energy LP (NS.N), which on Tuesday closed its 13-million-barrel Statia terminal on the small island of St. Eustatius, said several tanks and other equipment were damaged in the hurricane, so no restart date has been set. Firms using tanks in closed terminals in St. Eustatius, St. Croix, Bahamas and Puerto Rico include traders Vitol, Glencore (GLEN.L), Novum Energy and Freepoint Commodities, and oil firms PDVSA from Venezuela, China s Sinopec (600028.SS), Russia s Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and Lukoil (LKOH.MM), U.S. Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), according to the sources and Reuters vessel data. As traders worry about Irma s impact on inventories, others see longer-term potential consequences from this or other storms, as both Jose, now in the Atlantic Ocean, and Katia, off Mexico s coast, continued moving on Thursday after strengthening to hurricanes.  If a hurricane with Irma s intensity strikes a terminal tank farm, the force of the storm at the eye wall will have destructive impact on the storage tanks, which are typically not designed to withstand those forces,  said Ernie Barsamian, chief executive officer of the Tank Tiger, a terminal storage clearinghouse. Mexican state-run oil company Pemex said on Thursday that its facilities have not been hit so far, but it keeps monitoring Katia s path to decide if further action was needed. Fuel importers such as Mexico and Brazil have secured supplies in recent days from the U.S. East Coast, Europe and the Caribbean, according to traders, regulators and oil firms. But those options are running short amid growing regional demand and limited offers from Texas refiners as ports have been slow to reopen for large vessels. The only option that traders see for desperate buyers in the coming days is to divert fuel cargoes from countries such as Brazil, which bought diesel in excess, or Venezuela, which cannot pay for all the fuel floating near its ports because of the country s fiscal problems. At least three fuel cargoes have been diverted from Venezuela since last week, according to Reuters data. All of them have changed their destinations to Panama, likely to pass the Canal before discharging in South America.   Companies from Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru and Costa Rica are seeking spot cargoes of diesel, gasoline, aviation gasoline, asphalt and components on the open market, but few providers are willing to participate, traders said.  I cannot use my inventories in the Caribbean at this moment to supply third parties,  one trader said. Dominican Republic refining firm Refidomsa, which declared force majeure last week on deliveries, has been rationing fuel from its 34,000-barrel-per-day Haina refinery, giving it enough inventory for 20 days.  Most Caribbean refineries are dependent on U.S. light oil since large regional crude producers such as Mexico and Venezuela have cut exports to some neighbors.",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",0
4666,"Senators press Icahn on White House influence, business conflicts","Several Democratic senators pressed billionaire investor Carl Icahn on Monday to clarify his role as an adviser to President Donald Trump, saying his position in the administration raised “alarming” questions about potential conflicts of interest with his stakes in the biofuels and pharmaceutical industries. The senators, led by Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, sent a letter to Icahn pointing out that, as a Trump adviser on regulation, he has made policy proposals that benefit his own investments - which range from an oil refinery to an nutritional supplement manufacturer. “We write because we are increasingly concerned about the role you are playing in the Trump Administration and the possibility that you are breaking federal conflict of interest laws,” the seven senators wrote in the letter, seen by Reuters. Calls to Icahn’s office and lawyer were not immediately answered.  Icahn has been thrust into the limelight in recent weeks after the Renewable Fuels Association said he had informed them that Trump was preparing an executive order to overhaul the U.S. biofuels program in a way that benefited refiners. The White House quickly denied it had an executive order in the works, and pointed out that Icahn held an informal, unpaid role as adviser to Trump.  The senators said that despite the administration downplaying his role, Icahn has disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that he was a special adviser, meaning it is important to shareholders of the companies in which he holds stakes in.  Icahn owns an 82 percent stake in CVR Energy, which along with other refining companies, has called for changes to the Renewable Fuel Program to shift the burden of blending biofuels into gasoline away from refiners and further down stream to marketers. Icahn has said the change would help the entire refining industry, not just CVR.  Icahn also owns stakes in Herbalife and Bristol Meyers-Squib. The senators said Icahn had helped Trump pick the heads of the Treasury, Commerce, and the SEC, which have some oversight over the companies in which he has a stake. “Your ownership of each of these companies – and others – raises alarming questions about how you, and the Trump Administration, are handling your many conflicts of interest,” the senators wrote. In their letter, the senators said Icahn should be re-classified by the Trump administration as a special government employee, making him subject to ethics requirements.  When Trump announced in December that Icahn would be a special adviser, Trump made clear he would “not be serving as a federal employee or a Special Government Employee and will not have any specific duties.” The letter also includes over a dozen questions about Icahn’s ties to the administration, including whether he has received waivers from ethics requirements, and whether he has divested from some of his financial holdings.",politicsNews,"March 27, 2017 ",1

19214,"Deadly aftershock, volcanic ash spread alarm in Mexico","A magnitude 6.2 aftershock that shook Mexico on Saturday was blamed for five deaths, spreading fear among anxious residents reeling from a string of natural disasters and interrupting the search for survivors from a bigger tremor earlier this week. The Popocatepetl volcano south of Mexico City sent a column of ash into the sky, capping an intense period of seismic activity including two powerful tremors this month that have killed more than 400 people and caused damage of up to $8 billion. Mexico s capital was shattered by Tuesday s magnitude 7.1 quake that flattened dozens of buildings and killed at least 307 people. The government s response to the disaster is under close scrutiny ahead of a presidential election next year. Although the latest quake was not as destructive, fear is  running high among the population. Terrified residents ran into the streets, where they crouched and prayed as earthquake sirens went off. Two women died of heart attacks as the ground shook, the city government said. Tents were set up in different parts of the city where psychologists offered mental health support to survivors and rescuers traumatized by the natural disasters. Acts of solidarity came from all corners of Mexican society. Tuesday s quake hit on the anniversary of a 1985 tremor that, by some estimates, killed 10,000 people. Roxana Trani, a 30-year-old banker, was one of the thousands of young Mexicans who turned to social media to find out how to help. She joined one of the aid collection centers that popped up in Mexico City and traveled to Puebla state in one of many convoys flooding from the city to more isolated communities.  I never understood why the people who suffered the  85 quake were so afraid of the slightest tremors. Now I get it,  Trani said.   Being at a funeral and seeing all the pain that one minute caused has changed me,  she said. Concern that the aftershock could cause further collapses paralyzed rescue efforts at a housing complex in the Tlalpan neighborhood of Mexico City, frustrating first responders who  believed people were alive under the rubble. By the evening, hard-hatted first responders were again digging for bodies or survivors in a dwindling number of rubble heaps. Their work barely skipped a beat elsewhere when earthquake alarms twice rang out across the city. The United States Geological Survey said the latest quake was relatively shallow with an epicenter near Juchitan, a tropical region of Oaxaca state hard hit by a massive 8.1 magnitude tremor that struck on Sept. 7. Three people died in Oaxaca during Saturday s tremor, including a man who was attacked by a swarm of wild bees, authorities said.  Mexico s seismological authorities said it was an aftershock of the Sept. 7 tremor, which was the strongest to hit the country in 85 years and killed at least 98 people. The Popocatepetl volcano, which is visible on a clear day to the approximately 20 million people who live in the Mexico City metropolitan region, spewed vapor and ash-filled gas after two small eruptions on Saturday. Dozens of buildings were brought to the ground by Tuesday s earthquake, while an army of trained rescuers helped by droves of volunteers frantically removed rubble in a day-and-night search for survivors. Apartment buildings, offices, a school and a textile factory were among the structures flattened, leaving thousands homeless. The search had wound up at many sites by Saturday. Officials said there could be some 30,000 badly damaged homes in the adjacent states of Morelos and Puebla. RMS, a risk modeling company, estimated economic losses of $4 billion to $8 billion. Mexican volunteers, professionals and soldiers backed by teams from the United States and countries as far away as Japan and Chile have saved 69 people from the rubble after several days of searching. But in the past 48 hours rescuers have found more corpses than survivors, and frustration was mounting.

3318,Ex-FBI chief Comey tells U.S. senators Trump pressured him on Russia probe,"Former FBI Director James Comey said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump asked him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of a probe into Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In written testimony released the day before he appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey said Trump told him at a meeting in the White House in February: “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” The testimony puts more pressure on Trump, a Republican, whose presidency has been overshadowed by allegations that Moscow helped him win last year’s election. Some legal experts said Comey’s testimony could strengthen any impeachment case built on obstruction of justice, but U.S. markets shrugged off the news from the testimony for lack of any major disclosures. To build a criminal obstruction of justice case, federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with “corrupt” intent. It does not matter whether the person succeeds in impeding an investigation. While a sitting president is very unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment. Comey said he had told Trump on three occasions he was not being investigated, confirming an earlier account from the president. Trump, who spent part of Wednesday in Ohio talking about the need to fix the nation’s crumbling infrastructure, ignored reporters’ shouted questions about Comey. On returning to the Oval Office, Trump went into a meeting with top advisers, including chief of staff Reince Priebus. Later, his outside counsel released a statement saying Trump felt “completely and totally vindicated” by Comey’s account. “The president is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the president was not under investigation in any Russian probe,” Marc Kasowitz, Trump’s attorney, said in a statement. Several congressional committees, as well as the FBI and a special counsel, are investigating whether Russia tried to tilt last November’s election in Trump’s favor, using means such as hacking into the emails of senior Democrats. Trump and the Kremlin have separately denied any collusion. Trump abruptly fired Comey, who was leading the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s probe, on May 9. Comey painted a vivid picture for senators of awkward encounters with Trump in seven pages of testimony. Comey described a private dinner in the Green Room of the White House on Jan. 26, where Trump asked him whether he wanted to stay on as FBI director, telling him: “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.” “I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence,” Comey said in his testimony, explaining he became concerned that Trump was trying to create “some sort of patronage relationship.” On Feb. 14, after an Oval Office briefing on counterterrorism, Trump asked Comey to stay behind, dismissing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who lingered, and waving off Priebus, who peeked through the door. “When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the president began by saying, ‘I want to talk about Mike Flynn,’” Comey said in his testimony. Trump had fired Flynn the previous day in a controversy over contacts between the retired general and the Russian ambassador to the United States. The FBI has been investigating Flynn as it looks into allegations of links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Comey quoted Trump as telling him: “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” On March 30, Trump phoned Comey and asked what “we could do to lift the cloud” of the FBI’s Russia investigation. “He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia,” said Comey, who had briefed Trump on “salacious material” that had arisen in a counter-intelligence investigation. Michael Cohen, a lawyer for Trump, said in a statement that the uncorroborated dossier of compromising material that Russian operatives allegedly collected on Trump has been “debunked.”  “Comey’s statement released today needs to be carefully scrutinized as his testimony claims the president was concerned about the dossier,” said Cohen. Cohen, along with Flynn, has been subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee, which is also conducting a Russia probe. Some legal experts said Comey’s written statement could be used to show that Trump engaged in obstruction of justice. “It shows the president was doing everything he could to shut down the Flynn investigation,” said Andrew Wright, a professor of criminal law at Savannah Law School.  Bruce Green, a professor of law at Fordham University School of Law, said it would be difficult, however, to show that Trump intended to obstruct justice. Trump could say he was merely vouching for Flynn’s character and voicing concerns about how the probe was interfering with his ability to function effectively as president, Green said. Democrats jumped on the testimony, expressing concern that Trump had inappropriately meddled with the probe. “It’s certainly very possible that this is evidence, in combination with other actions by the president, that could amount to obstruction. It’s certainly an effort to interfere in the investigation,” the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff, told CNN. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, asked about Trump’s request for loyalty from Comey, said it was “very, very critical” that FBI directors remain “independent.” But Republican Senator Richard Burr, who heads the Senate intelligence panel, said he did not take issue with Trump’s request. “I don’t think it’s wrong to ask for loyalty from anybody in an administration,” Burr said.",politicsNews,"June 7, 2017 ",1

11131,AWESOME! WATCH REPUBLICAN STUDENTS Protest Award To Professor Who Called Trump A Terrorist [Video],"In a rare move, a throng of Republican students upset at ongoing harassment they face on campus took their complaints to the ultimate authority   the board of trustees (video below). Two liberals speak at the beginning of the video then Republican students get into it with well thought out arguments. It s the right way to protest!Some two dozen people   many of whom students   converged at the Coast Community College District board meeting en masse last week to voice concern at the discrimination they face at their school, asking for measures to protect them from discrimination based on their political diversity and ideological beliefs.As the parade of students spoke, applause and high fives echoed through the room during a meeting that was charged with high emotion.Many were also there to protest the fact that an instructor at the school, Olga Perez Stable Cox, who told her human sexuality class that Donald Trump s election was an assault and  act of terrorism,  recently earned the faculty of the year award.SHAKY CAMERA ALERT! A liberal is the first to speak about  extremist views  but the people in attendance weren t having it. A professor who calls our President a terrorist is pretty darned extremist. The 7 minute mark is where the Republican students get to speak:Signs including  flunk Olga  were held by some in the audience, and others wore bright-red Make America Great Again and Trump hats.Joshua Recalde-Martinez, a conservative student who s been targeted with online death threats and graffiti vandalism, was the first of many students to speak at the meeting. This is not a left or right issue, this is a common-sense solution to a problem which springs from extremist partisan feelings from either side of the political spectrum against the other, and sadly those who advocate against these amendments seek to only allow further discrimination on college campuses throughout the district,  said Recalde-Martinez, president emeritus of the OCC College Republicans.Vincent Wetzel, president of the OCC College Republicans, also spoke up. Saying he is a gay, Hispanic religious minority from a low-income household, he has never been more discriminated against for any other reason than being Republican. Republicans are the most targeted minority on our campus, and it is the duty of this board to defend minority students,  he said.Via: The College Fix",politics,"Apr 15, 2017",1

8157,New York attorney general opens probe of Trump Foundation,"New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Tuesday he had opened an inquiry into the Donald J. Trump Foundation to ensure the Republican presidential nominee’s charity was complying with state laws governing nonprofits. Schneiderman, a supporter of Trump’s Democratic rival in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton, sued the real estate mogul and his now defunct Trump University for fraud in 2013, seeking $40 million in restitution plus penalties and other costs. In a CNN interview on Tuesday, Schneiderman said his office had now brought Trump’s charitable foundation under scrutiny. “My interest in this issue really is in my capacity as regulator of nonprofits in New York state. And we have been concerned that the Trump Foundation may have engaged in some impropriety from that point of view,” the elected Democratic official said. He added: “We have been looking into the Trump Foundation to make sure it’s complying with the laws that govern charities in New York.” He did not elaborate on what wrongdoing Trump’s nonprofit might have committed. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung dismissed Schneiderman’s assertions as entirely motivated by presidential politics, calling the attorney general a “partisan hack who has turned a blind eye to the Clinton Foundation for years.” Cheung called Schneiderman’s comments “nothing more than another left-wing hit job designed to distract” attention from Clinton’s recent missteps on the campaign trail. Trump has accused Clinton of being corrupted by donors to the Clinton Foundation global charity founded by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, while she was U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Clinton has dismissed Trump’s allegation as a political smear. There has been no evidence that foreign donors to the foundation obtained favors from the State Department while Clinton headed the agency. Schneiderman made his remarks when asked on CNN about calls from Democrats in Congress for a federal investigation of a $25,000 donation in 2013 from the Trump Foundation to a political committee supporting Florida’s Republican attorney general, Pam Bondi.  Democrats have cited an Associated Press report that Bondi solicited the donation personally, around the time her office was debating whether to join New York state’s investigation into Trump’s real estate training school in Florida. According to the AP, Bondi, who was seeking re-election at the time, broke off the lawsuit deliberations after the check arrived. Bondi, who has endorsed Trump, has called the AP report misleading.",politicsNews,"September 13, 2016 ",1
2134,Trump's stance on Virginia violence shocks America's allies,"America’s closest allies condemned U.S. President Donald Trump in unusually strong and personal terms on Wednesday after he put part of the blame for violent clashes in the state of Virginia on those marching against gun-brandishing neo-Nazis. British Prime Minister Theresa May, widely criticised at home for cultivating close ties to Trump during his first half year in office, spoke out after the president repeated his view that the white nationalists and counter-protesters were both to blame. “There’s no equivalence, I see no equivalence between those who propound fascist views and those who oppose them and I think it is important for all those in positions of responsibility to condemn far-right views wherever we hear them,” May said. The leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats said May should rescind her invitation to Trump to pay a state visit to Britain. “After. @realDonaldTrump whitewash of murder and hatred by #WhiteSupremacists why is he still on list of invited official guests to UK?” Vince Cable tweeted. Politicians in Germany, which has tough laws against hate speech and any symbols linked to the Nazis who murdered 6 million Jews in the Holocaust, expressed shock at the images of people in Charlottesville, Virginia carrying swastikas and chanting anti-Jewish slurs.  Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the “racist, far-right violence”. Her challenger in next month’s election called Trump’s comments the “confused utterances” of a dangerous man. “We should not tolerate the monstrosities coming out of the president’s mouth,” Martin Schulz told the RND newspaper group in an interview. German Justice Minister Heiko Maas, like Schulz a member of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) which rules in coalition with Merkel, accused Trump of trivialising anti-Semitism and racism. His Israeli counterpart, Ayelet Shaked, a member of the ultranationalist Jewish Home party in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, tweeted: “The neo-Nazis in the United States should be prosecuted. This was not what the American constitution was meant for.” In a heated news conference on Tuesday, Trump said there was “blame on both sides” for the violence, which culminated in the death of a 32-year-old woman, Heather Heyer, after a car crashed into anti-racist demonstrators. A 20-year-old Ohio man said to have harboured Nazi sympathies has been charged with her murder. Trump’s remarks were praised by white supremacists like David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, who applauded the president’s “honesty and courage”. But in Europe, even far-right parties that have welcomed Trump’s nationalist message, were critical of his stance. “These were white supremacists and racists. They need to be condemned in very clear terms,” said Florian Philippot, vice president of France’s National Front and the manager of Marine Le Pen’s campaign for the French presidency.

20794,"U.N. mulls U.S. push for North Korea oil embargo, textile export ban","The United States wants the United Nations Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban the country s exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad, and subject leader Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has said she wants the 15-member council to vote on Monday on the draft resolution to impose new sanctions over North Korea s sixth and largest nuclear test. However, Russia s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia has said a Monday vote may be  a little premature.  It was not immediately clear if the draft resolution had the support of North Korean ally China. Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted on Wednesday that resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis was impossible with sanctions and pressure alone. A U.N. resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, Russia or China to pass. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that if the Security Council did not act, he had an executive order prepared to send to President Donald Trump that would  authorize me to stop doing trade and put sanctions on anybody that does trade with North Korea.   The president will consider that at the appropriate time once he gives the U.N. time to act,  Mnuchin told reporters.  Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted eight resolutions ratcheting up sanctions on North Korea over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. Haley said the incremental approach had not worked and a diplomatic solution could only be reached by imposing the strongest sanctions. The new draft U.N. resolution would ban exports to North Korea of crude oil, condensate, refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids. China supplies most of North Korea s crude. According to South Korean data, Beijing supplies roughly 500,000 tonnes of crude oil annually. It also exports 200,000 tonnes of oil products, according to U.N. data. Russia s exports of crude oil to North Korea are about 40,000 tonnes a year. The Security Council last month imposed new sanctions over North Korea s two long-range missile launches in July. The Aug. 5 resolution aimed to slash by a third Pyongyang s $3 billion annual export revenue by banning coal, iron, lead and seafood. The new draft resolution would remove an exception for transshipments of Russian coal via the North Korean port of Rajin. In 2013 Russia reopened a railway link with North Korea, from the Russian eastern border town of Khasan to Rajin, to export coal and import goods from South Korea and elsewhere. The Aug. 5 resolution capped the number of North Koreans working abroad at the current level. The new draft resolution would impose a complete ban on the hiring and payment of North Korean laborers abroad. Some diplomats estimate that between 60,000 and 100,000 North Koreans work abroad. A U.N. human rights investigator said in 2015 that North Korea was forcing more than 50,000 people to work abroad, mainly in Russia and China, earning between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion a year. The wages of workers sent abroad provide foreign currency for the Pyongyang government. The draft resolution would ban textiles, which were North Korea s second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totaling $752 million, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). Nearly 80 percent of the textile exports went to China. The assets of military-controlled airline Air Koryo would be frozen if the draft resolution is adopted. It flies to Beijing and a few other cities in China, including Dandong, the main transit point for trade between the two countries. It also flies to Vladivostok in Russia. Along with blacklisting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the draft resolution would impose a travel ban and asset freeze on four other senior North Korean officials. The Worker s Party of Korea and the government of North Korea would also be subjected to an asset freeze. The draft resolution would allow states to intercept and inspect on the high seas vessels that have been blacklisted by the Security Council. Currently nearly two dozen vessels are listed and the new draft text would add another nine ships. The draft resolution does not contain any new language on the political track. It again reaffirms council support and calls for a resumption of talks between North Korea, the United States, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia. China and Russia have been pushing their proposal to kick-start talks with a joint suspension of North Korea s ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the military exercises by the United States and South Korea. Haley has dismissed the suggestion as  insulting.",worldnews,"September 6, 2017 ",1
17177,Underdog center-left party may outperform expectations in Japan snap poll,"A new center-left party pledging to bring  bottom up  democracy to Japan may prove the surprise success story of an election on Sunday, although the party is forecast to win a mere sliver of seats compared to Prime Minister Shinto Abe s ruling bloc. Abe s conservative Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition is on track to roughly match the two-thirds  super majority  it held in parliament s lower house before dissolution, helped by divisions in the opposition camp and jitters over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs, media forecasts say. But the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) formed just this month could become the core of opposition to Abe s LDP if, as some forecast, it challenges Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike s flashier conservative Party of Hope for the top opposition spot. The CDPJ opposes Abe s proposal to revise the post-war, pacifist constitution to clarify the ambiguous status of the military. Whether to revise the U.S.-drafted charter has long been a symbolic marker dividing Japan s left and right, and Abe is expected to use his big win to push for amendments. CDPJ founder Yukio Edano, 53, who grabbed the spotlight as Japan s top spokesman during the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis, formed the CDPJ on the run after the main opposition Democratic Party s leader stunningly decided the party would run no candidates and encouraged members to run on Koike s slate. Edano told Japanese media he was inspired by the  Stand up, Edano  tweets he received after the Democrats imploded. Many Democrats jumped on the Hope bandwagon. Others either declined to join or were shut out after refusing to sign off on a hawkish security stance that echoes that of the LDP. Some joined Edano s party, others are running as independents. A Sankei newspaper survey published on Tuesday predicted the CDPJ would get between 46 and 60 seats, compared to initial estimates that about 30 of its 78 candidates would be elected.  That compared to 39 to 57 seats for the Party of Hope, which is running 235 candidates. [tmsnrt.rs/2kGwCm5] A Kyodo news agency survey released on Wednesday also forecast the CDPJ could become the biggest opposition group. If so, that would suggest voters unhappy with Abe are seeking not a conservative replica of the LDP but a more liberal alternative, political analysts said. The failed Democratic Party was a fractious mix of liberals and conservatives, saddled with an image of incompetence after a rocky 2009-2012 rule.  Almost all parties have been conservative and there is no party for liberal voters to vote for,  said University of Tokyo professor Yu Uchiyama.  If this party is successful in attracting liberal votes, there could be a prospect to do well.  Edano, however, eschews what he calls outdated labels such as  liberal  or  left , terms often associated with Cold War-era socialists or communists that can turn off mainstream voters.Unlike the more authoritarian LDP, he stresses commitment to individual civil rights, rather than obligations to the state, and wants to redistribute wealth to create a more equitable society.  I want to take a first step toward creating a  bottom up  society ... toward a trend that is neither left, nor right, but moves forward,  Edano said during a debate this month. The lack of preparation time, and a shortage of cash and candidates will be formidable obstacles for the CDPJ to overcome.  It could also struggle to differentiate its economic policies from those of the LDP, which has long been more center-left than right when it comes to bread-and-butter issues. Edano s group wants to put off a sales tax hike and exit nuclear power. The LDP says it will keep nuclear power as a key energy source and raise the sales tax in 2019 but divert revenue to education and child care from repaying public debt. Both parties promise equal pay for equal work, higher wages for day care and elder care workers and more financial support for education, although they differ on details. A Reuters poll published Wednesday showed Japanese companies overwhelmingly want Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s ruling coalition to stay in power but about two-thirds want it to lose seats. The poll showed significant opposition in the corporate world to Abe s plans to raise the sales tax and to delay bringing down the fiscal deficit.  Abenomics would be comfortably left-of-center in most developed democracies,  said Tobias Harris, an analyst at advisory firm Teneo Intelligence. A healthy showing by the CDPJ could lure more lawmakers to its ranks after the election, although low voter turnout could diminish its performance as could competition with the Japanese Communist Party on the left.  If the CDPJ comes in second, in a couple of months they will have grown and become the core of a new center-left opposition party,  said Chuo University professor Steven Reed.",worldnews,"October 18, 2017 ",0

17541,Catalonia's independence leader wages his own battle for unity,"Moments before Catalonia s leader, Carles Puigdemont, baulked at declaring independence from Spain this week, cracks were already appearing in his secessionist ranks. Some members of his political alliance say they were waiting for him at Barcelona s 18th-century regional parliament building on Tuesday evening, fully expecting him to call for an independence vote in the chamber that night. Instead, after arriving late, to the cheers of thousands of supporters, the former journalist and lifetime advocate of independence told his allies an hour before entering the chamber that there had been a late change of plan, according to one of those present. There would be no vote. Instead, Puigdemont made a symbolic declaration of independence, then suspended it and called for negotiations with Madrid.  We are annoyed, we are hurt, we are angry because he came up with a strategic change one hour before the parliamentary session,  said Carles Riera, a member of the Catalan parliament from the far-left CUP party, which backs an unequivocal declaration of independence and whose support keeps Puigdemont s minority government alive.  A spokesman for Puigdemont s party denied he had surprised all of his own political allies, saying his core coalition had agreed the plan in the morning. The CUP was not included in that morning meeting but was informed afterwards, the spokesman said, without saying when. The CUP s claim of betrayal reveals the shaky political foundations upon which Catalonia s independence movement is built, a jumble of parties ranging from anti-capitalists to free marketeers whose only common cause is to split from Spain. There are now doubts over Puigdemont s ability to survive the worst confrontation between Catalonia, a former principality with its own language and culture, and Madrid in 40 years. Members of the CUP say Puigdemont lost his nerve at the crucial moment. One CUP lawmaker present at the meeting, Eulalia Reguant, quit the day after, citing his reversal. Instead of persuading Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to accept talks, his gesture was met with an ultimatum: renounce independence by Thursday or Madrid will use its constitutional power to take control of the region directly. Now Puigdemont, 54, finds himself in a struggle with not only Madrid, but also internally with the CUP, which may end up being the bigger danger for his political career and for his  prospects of winning another regional election on a pro-independence platform. The small CUP party had ousted Puigdemont s predecessor as Catalan president, Artur Mas, in 2015. It refused to back the mainstream independence coalition, Junts pel Si, unless Mas stepped down.  If Puigdemont backs down and says we tried but this is not working, unilateral secession isn t doable, I don t think CUP will support him again,  said Eurasia analyst Federico Santi. He said Puigdemont s party was already sliding in opinion polls. In the final hour before Puigdemont stood up in the regional parliament to announce that he was suspending the independence push, he also made it clear to those in his political circle that their voices were not the only ones that mattered.  I am talking to the world,  he told them when pressed for an explanation, according to two people who were present. Some in the room said they suspected he had taken a phone call from a senior EU figure in Brussels, though the heads of the two main EU political institutions, Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, said it was not them. One EU official, however, said there was reason to believe that an emotional personal appeal Tusk had made publicly to Puigdemont a couple of hours before he was due to speak had weighed on the Catalan leader s decision. Puigdemont has always considered world opinion as crucial to Catalan independence: as a journalist in the 1990s, he traveled Europe to research media impressions of Catalonia and wrote a book,  Cata ... que?  (Cata ... what?). A supporter of the European Union, he switches easily from Catalan to Spanish, French or Romanian, the native language of his wife, whom he met at the Catalan News Agency he founded.  The president made a speech which was very much addressed to EU institutions and governments,  a Catalan government source said on condition of anonymity. Puigdemont also made clear that he considered it would be Spain s responsibility if it rejected his offer of dialogue. Several neighboring countries criticized Spain s use of force to disrupt Catalonia s Oct. 1 independence referendum, which had been banned by Madrid. Hundreds were injured when police used batons and rubber bullets on voters. The crackdown, though, fired up independence supporters and hardened expectations among Puigdemont s base that he would unilaterally declare independence in parliament. When he didn t, supporters watching his speech on large screens outside the assembly buried their heads in their hands, some wept, and they rolled up their Catalan flags and went home. Inside, the recriminations were well underway. Some lawmakers in Puigdemont s Junts pel Si coalition said they, too, had only been informed of his tactic at the 11th hour, though the spokesman for Puigdemont s party denied this. The government source said Catalan companies leaving the region in the days before his speech had also weighed on Puigdemont s mind. Several firms, including Catalonia s two major banks, moved their legal headquarters to other parts of Spain. Some anxious Catalan depositors traveled to neighboring regions to open bank accounts there. Jordi Alberich, director of Barcelona-based business association Cercle D Economia, met Puigdemont on Oct. 7.   He seemed to be very conscious of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence,  Alberich said.   He was very worried about companies fleeing.",worldnews,"October 13, 2017 ",1

Jurors were unable to reach a verdict on Ryan Bundy s theft of government property charge.The jury returned its verdict after some six weeks of testimony followed by less than six hours deliberations, and the last minute replacement of a juror after an allegation surfaced that he was biased.The jury was instructed to disregard their previous work and to reconsider the evidence. It was a pretty jaw-dropping verdict,  said OPB reporter Amelia Templeton of the climate in the courtroom. The jury began by reading out the verdict for Ammon Bundy, ostensibly the leader of the occupation, and when we heard that Ammon Bundy was not guilty, it became clear very quickly that likely no one in the case was going to be found guilty, and indeed, everyone has been acquitted.

It is unclear whether the case will be retried because Navarro did not rule whether the mistrial was with or without prejudice.She has set another hearing for January and has tentatively scheduled a new trial to begin Feb. 26.Navarro suspended the trial two weeks ago and warned of a potential mistrial after prosecutors for the first time disclosed several documents that appeared to support defense claims about the government s use of video surveillance and sniper teams during the standoff.Prosecutors have long maintained the FBI was not involved in the standoff and that no video surveillance or sniper teams were used. They charged defendants with making false claims about snipers and videos to incite militia in the runup to the standoff.Lawyers raise self-defenseDocuments turned over by the prosecution after the start of the trial indicated the FBI played an active role in the standoff and that surveillance camera and armed tactical teams were positioned around the Bundy Ranch.Defense lawyers filed motions to dismiss the case, arguing the new documents provided critical evidence that would have allowed them to challenge the government s charges, impeach government witnesses and lay the foundation for self-defense claims.The Bundys launched a social-media rallying cry. Hundreds of supporters, including members of several militia groups, converged on the Bundy Ranch. Federal agents abandoned the roundup, saying they were outgunned and in fear for their lives.Last year, the government charged 19 people with conspiracy, assault, extortion and weapons violations for their roles in the standoff. Two men took plea deals. Trials for the remaining 17 defendants were broken into three tiers based on their alleged levels of culpability.Bundy has maintained there was no conspiracy and that supporters were staging a peaceful protest and exercising their constitutional rights to bear arms.For many Americans, images of the four-day standoff in a dusty wash below Interstate 15 about 70 miles northeast of Las Vegas were shocking. Hundreds of protesters, ranchers and militia members took armed positions around federal law-enforcement officers, some lying prone on freeway overpasses and sighting down long rifles.But making a solid case against Bundy and his supporters has so far eluded prosecutors. Two federal juries in Las Vegas have rejected conspiracy claims against six defendants in earlier trials.

13545,Three dead bodies pulled from sea near Spain after migrant boat sinks,"Spanish rescue services pulled three drowned men from the Strait of Gibraltar after rescuing one man from a half-sunken, rickety boat and another from the open sea, an emergency services spokeswoman said on Wednesday. The men are believed to be from a boat that was carrying migrants attempting to cross into Europe, the spokeswoman said. One of the rescued men said there were six people aboard originally, she said. The search continues for the sixth person. Conditions in the Strait of Gibraltar - a narrow strip of water that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea - are currently dangerous with bad weather and big waves, she said.  Tens of thousands of migrants attempt the treacherous crossing of the Mediterranean Sea from Africa every year in unseaworthy boats, leading to thousands of deaths by drowning. Migrant drownings have topped 3,000 on Mediterranean Sea routes for the fourth straight year, the International Organization for Migration said on Tuesday. Migrants seeking a better life in Europe have sought new routes through Spain in an effort to get around European Union actions to curb migration in the central and eastern Mediterranean. Almost 10,300 people arrived in Spain by sea in the first seven months of 2017, the IOM said in September, four times as many as in 2016.",worldnews,"November 29, 2017 ",0

13913,UPDATE: TRANSGENDER TARGET BOYCOTT Reaches Boiling Point…Loses $4 BILLION In 30 Days…CEO Defends Dangerous Bathroom Position,"Note to Target CEO: When you endanger the safety of little girls and women in your stores, you re giving  placing a  target  on your back  a whole new meaning. Only two days ago in women s bathroom in Chicago, an 8 year old girl was choked by a man until she was unconscious. He proceeded to drag into a bathroom stall. Fortunately, her mother overheard her screams and was able to come to her rescue. Is this really the kind of America we want? Is Target ready to accept responsibility for crimes against women and children in their bathrooms and changing rooms?UPDATE: Target is facing a nationwide backlash for its support of transgender rights.More than 1.2 million people have signed a pledge to boycott the retailer after it announced last month that it would welcome transgender customers to use any bathroom or fitting room that matches their gender identity.Critics have been holding protests and demonstrations at stores across the country, and they are showing no signs of dying down.Many are demanding access to bathrooms of the opposite sex to support claims that  perverts  can now prey on children and women as a result of the policy.The boycotters  goal is to force Target to reverse its policy, or at least make the retailer suffer for it by spending their money elsewhere.  Breitbart NewsThe CEO of retail giant Target is zig-zagging between the many customers who are angered by his decision to open single-sex bathrooms to the other sex, the gender-identity progressives who pushed for the disastrous transgender policy, and the Wall Street stock-pickers who have chopped roughly $4.5 billion off the company s value. We re going to continue to embrace our belief in diversity and inclusion, just how important that is to our company, CEO Brian Cornell said in a May 11 appearance on CNBC s  Squawk Box  business show.  But we re also going to make sure our focus on safety is unwavering,  he added.To mollify the public angered by his removal of single-sex restrooms and changing rooms, the company will add family bathrooms to all of its stores, he said.We re committed over the next few months, to make sure every one of our stores has that option, because we want to make sure that our guests be welcomed in our stores. But if there s a question of safety, I can tell you and others, our focus on safety is unwavering, and we want to make sure we provide a welcoming environment for all our guests, one that s safe, one that s comfortable.But Cornell did not offer to return single-sex changing rooms, which is likely the most unnerving element in the company s new open-door, pro-transgender agenda.The company can t easily add family changing-rooms without using up scarce space in their retail stores   and can t reestablish single-sex changing-rooms without angering many progressive professionals in the media and fashion industries. Those progressives professionals would likely claim the company is unfairly  gender policing  its customers, even though transgender advocates say only 1 in every 300 Americans are transgender. Other estimates say the ratio is only 1 transgender for every 2,400 Americans.So Cornell tried to reassure and flatter progressives about the justice of his company s brand-damaging, revenue-reducing April 19 decision.  We took a stance,  Cornell said, as he suggested that single-sex bathrooms are just like a racist refusal to use African-Americans in commercial advertising in the 1960s.We ve had a long history embracing diversity and inclusion. A couple weeks ago, one of our team members sent me a note reminding me that if we went back to the mid-60s, our company was one of the very first to use African-American models in their advertising, and back then, it wasn t well received.In the company s initial April 19 statement, the store said,  we welcome transgender team members and [customer] guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity. The statement came as Americans were recognizing and rejecting the revolutionary political agenda behind the push for transgender status.Since April 19,  We had a lot of tough feedback. But sitting here today, we know we made the right decision,  Cornell insisted.That tough feedback includes a consumer boycott that now has 1.2 million supporters, much damage to the company s brand, and a massive sell-off on Wall Street that has chopped the company s share price from almost $84 on April 19 to $75.70 on May 11.That s a loss of $8.30 per share, or 10 percent, or almost $5 billion since April 19. Of course, some part of that loss is due to President Barack Obama s weak economy   but no company is helped by many management decisions that anger so many customers.

9521,McCain ‘Associate’ Who Handled Trump Dossier Is Accused Of Dodging Subpoena In BuzzFeed Lawsuit,"Lawyers for a Russian tech executive suing BuzzFeed for publishing the Steele dossier say that a longtime associate of Arizona Sen. John McCain and two major news outlets are resisting subpoenas seeking their depositions for the case.In a brief filed in federal court late Wednesday, lawyers for the executive, Aleksej Gubarev, claim that David Kramer (pictured below), a former State Department official and McCain associate,  has been seemingly avoiding service  of a deposition subpoena for weeks.Please see the very curious input Reason.com put out just this July regarding Kramer s involvement in the Steele dossier getting into the hands of the press. And The New York Times and Wall Street Journal are challenging deposition subpoenas they have been served as part of the case.Gubarev s lawyers are attempting to find out who gave BuzzFeed the salacious dossier, which the website published to much controversy on Jan. 10.The dossier, written by former British spy Christopher Steele, alleges that Gubarev and his companies, XBT Holdings and Webzilla, used spam, viruses and porn bots to hack into DNC computer systems. Gubarev vehemently denies the allegations.Gubarev s attorneys say that identifying BuzzFeed s source could shed light on whether the news outlet was warned that information in the dossier could be false. They argue that publishing the dossier despite such warnings would show  reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the information published. BuzzFeed has defended its decision to publish the dossier, which was financed by the Clinton campaign and DNC and commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS. It is also resisting demands from Gubarev s team to identify its dossier source on the grounds that it would violate its First Amendment protections as a news-gathering organization.Via: Daily CallerReason had this to say on July 16th on the mystery surrounding how the fake dossier got into the hands of Buzzed:Did John McCain and a controversial D.C. lobbying group conspire to get the infamous  pee dossier  into the hands of the press?A lawsuit making its way through court in the UK hopes to determine just what role the senator and his associates had in making the lurid dossier public.New filings in the lawsuit, obtained by McClatchy, detail how David Kramer employed by the nonprofit and purportedly non-political McCain Institute acted as a representative of McCain in the Arizona senator s dealings on sensitive intelligence measures:According to a new court document in the British lawsuit, counsel for defendants Steele and Orbis repeatedly point to McCain, R-Ariz., a vocal Trump critic, and a former State Department official as two in a handful of people known to have had copies of the full document before it circulated among journalists and was published by BuzzFeed.

23335,HEAD GAMES: Technology With The Potential To Shape Reality,"Randy Johnson 21st Century Wire  MIRROR MIRROR   Am I still just a movie concept?  Virtual  avatar  technology is in its infancy   as far as we know (Image: Actor Sam Worthington from the science fiction blockbuster film, Avatar).Is humanity s recent quantum leap with technology all fun and games, or a zombie-like march into the arms of a technocratic prison world?For generations we have seen global figures such as John F. Kennedy or Ronald Reagan speak on television and that s what we believed we have seen and heard.We have all heard, people say things such as  The President said it   it was on the news  or  she said it on TV, I saw it.  Ever since the invention of the medium of television, this has served as a sufficient casual reference to any event away from the local area.What if the words and image of a global figure, broadcast to millions on television, was not real?  What if your eyes and ears where literally deceiving you?Simply put, what if seeing isn t believing anymore?  What if the person on screen, on LIVE television, who is actually interacting with questions asked, was not the person being represented on screen?With technological advancements, as exemplified with the  still-in-development Face2Face system, the potential to present and act any person to an audience for multiple reasons, both good and bad, is here.  With respect to black budgets, exotic technology, and unknown classified advancements of similar computer systems and programs   technology beyond that of the Face2Face system could already be here and further advanced.What exactly is a Face2Face system?  TechCrunch.com describes it as taking,  A YouTube video of someone speaking like, say, George W. Bush.  Use a standard RGB [Red Green Blue] webcam to capture a video of someone else emoting and saying something entirely different.  Throw both videos into the Face2Face system and  you ve now got a relatively believable video of George W. Bush s face   now almost entirely synthesized   doing whatever the actor in the second video wanted the target s face to do. If the definition eludes you, then take a look at the Face2Face system in action.Watch below as life-like avatars of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Vladimir Putin follow visual commands in real time via the Face2Face system. That s great.  What about the voice you might ask?It does not take a wild imagination to envision voice software programs linked up with visual avatars for something like the Face2Face system in real time.Celebrity  voice changer  technology or other  voice morphing  software is already available at the consumer level.  Many security systems, phones, and buildings grant access by authenticating a person s voice.  There is even a real danger for people to have their actual voice  hacked  as they leave samples of it everywhere throughout the day.If the Face2Face technology, in a development stage as seen above, as does voice changing and voice recognition technology exists, then it only follows that the audio and the visual technology are destined to sync up.Just think of the implications.You could potentially have John Wayne, Elvis, Michael Jordan, Osama bin Laden, Miley Cyrus, or Justin Beiber wishing you happy birthday on a video message and interacting with you   Live.  It isn t really them, but then again it is them, just in a virtual reality sort of way.  Could there eventually be monetary charges to use the likeness of famous people dead or alive with certain companies owning certain celebrity s long dead and families of recent celebrities getting a cut?Perhaps a world leader could be dead for weeks and still delivering speeches or issuing orders. Anyone can be misquoted intentionally and questioned, framed, or made to fall from grace in the court of public opinion.  If you could take over another nation s airwaves, their leader can be seen saying something they said on television   except for the fact it isn t them and they never said it. Wars have been started for less.In the summer of 2015, 21WIRE discussed the use of a 3D avatar in the political realm, as India s Prime Minister Narendra Mohdi delivered a holographic speech at some 900 different rallies over the course of his campaign: Some would argue politicians are actors or entertainers in their own right, but hologram use is not limited to entertainers. Narendra Mohdi has already used the technology during his successful campaign to become India s Prime Minister. What would the future of electioneering look like with this new high-tech gadgetry?It has long been known that US political strategists have shaped elections throughout the world.In 2015, Hollywood released a fictionalized political comedy-drama named after a documentary called Our Brand Is Crisis (2005), a picture which gave a behind-the-scenes account of how James Carville and the political consultancy Greenberg Carville Shrum (GCS) socially-engineered the 2002 Bolivian elections to help Gonzalo S nchez de Lozada win the heavily contested presidency. He eventually resigned due to the so-called  Gas Wars,  where it was announced that he would follow pro-US economic policies and export natural gas to the US and Mexico.The documentary displays much of the socially-engineered electioneering that has been ongoing by the West for decades   it makes you wonder what future Western-backed campaigns might look like when aided by new tech, such as Spain s recent holographic protests, that featured thousands marching in avatar form.

Just consider the now common scene below.  NOMOPHOBIA    Technology, consumerism, and human behavior together.  So close, yet so far away   (Image Source: mymimtimsum.blogspot.com)Mass media in particular, is often utilized to shape opinions, drive agendas, and to communicate messages to the masses.  This is nothing new and can be as mundane as with advertising and marketing.  Specialized fields such as consumer psychologists and behavioral scientists became part of marketing teams and campaigns.  Corporations within the United States, China, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan spent over 590 billion dollars on advertising in 2015.  In so many words, shaping masses in various aspects of behavior is literally seen as a science.Is mainstream  news reporting  above the fray and simply covering events?  Is shaping minds and creating trends limited to marketing and mass commercialism?  Probably not.  It is now becoming common knowledge that 6 umbrella corporations own about 90% of the media.  If you steer the minds, shape the laws, and build the consensus, you control the profits and get to select winners and losers.

Movies, televisions, computers, the internet, and smart phones are the norm and were presented to the masses as a means of entertainment, news, communication or learning, but have a dark side of conditioning, monitoring people, propaganda dissemination and changing or controlling human outlooks on reality.For those old enough to remember life before the year 2000, they might remember having human interaction that included interaction in close proximity to others.  Now, so-called social networking is something not done in person.  It s almost fashionable for someone to ignore their surroundings and introvert themselves into the world  of a device.Nothing beats connecting with other people more than losing oneself into the cyber reality of a smart phone   DIGITAL SLAVE    This is becoming a familiar sight.

The Face2Face system technology above is not unlike the virtual reality (VR) technology used to map a person s face and expressions to a VR avatar. Mark Zukerberg s Facebook has shown heavy interest in the technology, most notably with its 2 billion dollar purchase of Silicon Valley VR firm Oculus Rift.The global acquisitions of talent and start-up companies with expertise in virtual reality technology by Facebook has been notable and they have stated their intent to integrate social networking with virtual reality and avatars.Nothing beats getting people together and networking than a visual representation of themselves in a virtual reality scenario.Get with it!

Virtual reality devices are not likely to become common overnight. However, over time, especially for those who can remember, it will probably be like when there were no smart phones. Eventually humankind could reach a point where few remember what it was like without it.In addition to Face2Face types of technology, holographic and projection technology, as seen with  Face Hacking , could be intertwined with Face-2-Face and voice morphing technologies.Read 21st Century Wire s article Face Hacking: 3-D Projection Mapping in Real Time here.The potential can be as amazing as it is disconcerting.

If anyone was expecting any actual evidence to be presented, they would have been sorely disappointed, again. Still, that s not going to stop Official Washington from burning though more public money to try and prove a conspiracy theory.  The issue of collusion is still open,  said committee chairman, Richard Burr of North Carolina (R).  We have more work to do as it relates to collusion, but we re developing a clearer picture of what happened. Likewise, the committee s ranking Democrat, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, admitted they had nothing, but implored Americans to  be on guard of the Russian. The Russian active measures did not end on Election Day 2016,  said Warner. He maintains that the US should adopt a  more aggressive  whole government  approach  to combat Russian influence on the vulnerable minds of unsuspecting Americans.However, yesterday 21WIRE revealed via Consortium News   that it was Senator Warner, along with the Obama White House, who colluded with Silicon Valley giant Facebook in 2016, with Warner making multiple trips to Palo Alto to pressure Facebook to produce some  evidence  that Warner and his colleagues could hold up as proof of  Russian Bots  using Facebook to interfere in the 2016 Election. As it turns out, this was fake news fabricated by Washington and its mainstream media partners.21WIRE editor Patrick Henningsen spoke to RT International yesterday about these developments, and how the US government is using their own fake news in order to shut down competition in the information sphere.

What would we do without them-they have pushed for the truth on so many things about Benghazi but other things that have happened during the lawless Obama years. Thanks to Judicial Watch for finally getting to the bottom of this!Judicial Watch Docs Reveal Obama Admin KNEW Al Qaeda Terrorists Planned Benghazi 10 Days In Advance (Washington, DC)   Judicial Watch announced today that it obtained more than 100 pages of previously classified  Secret  documents from the Department of Defense (DOD)and the Department of State revealing that DOD almost immediately reported that the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was committed by the al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood-linked  Brigades of the Captive Omar Abdul Rahman  (BCOAR), and had been planned at least 10 days in advance. Rahman is known as the Blind Sheikh, and is serving life in prison for his involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other terrorist acts. The new documents also provide the first official confirmation that shows the U.S. government was aware of arms shipments from Benghazi to Syria. The documents also include an August 2012 analysis warning of the rise of ISIS and the predicted failure of the Obama policy of regime change in Syria.The documents were released in response to a court order in accordance with a May 15, 2014, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed against both the DOD and State Department seeking communications between the two agencies and congressional leaders  on matters related to the activities of any agency or department of the U.S. government at the Special Mission Compound and/or classified annex in Benghazi. Spelling and punctuation is duplicated in this release without corrections.A Defense Department document from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), dated September 12, 2012, the day after the Benghazi attack, details that the attack on the compound had been carefully planned by the BOCAR terrorist group  to kill as many Americans as possible.  The document was sent to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Obama White House National Security Council.

9142,Cleveland sued over speech rights outside Republican convention,"Three groups planning to demonstrate at the Republican National Convention in July sued the city of Cleveland on Tuesday, seeking immediate changes to security measures due to their “unacceptable restrictions” on free speech. Presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump is expected to officially become the Republican Party’s candidate for president at the July 18-21 convention, which will attract protesters for various causes who plan to demonstrate outside. Trump campaign events have drawn large and raucous demonstrations, some of which have resulted in clashes between the candidate’s supporters and opponents. Led by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the three groups filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, naming the city of Cleveland and Mayor Frank Jackson as defendants. Dan Williams, a spokesman for the mayor, said in a phone call he had not seen the lawsuit and that the city does not comment on ongoing litigation. He said the city and the ACLU have discussed protester rights and regulations in meetings.     The plaintiffs are Citizens for Trump, a Texas-based group that supports the businessman’s campaign; Organize Ohio, a liberal activist group; and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, a charitable organization. The lawsuit contends that Cleveland has imposed an unnecessarily large restricted zone of 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) in the city center where free speech and mobility will be limited. “The limitations apply far beyond the part of the city where the convention activities will take place. ... These regulations severely limit the opportunities for members of the public to exercise their expressive rights during the convention,” the lawsuit said. The lawsuit seeks to reduce the size and regulations of the restricted an area and asks the court to immediately address the city’s rules for issuing protest permits and what the ACLU called persistent delays in approving those permits.  “Many of these applications have been pending for months - some as long as four months. The city’s continuing refusal to approve or deny these applications leaves the organizers of these activities in limbo,” the lawsuit said. Protesters need adequate time to make travel arrangements and rent needed materials such as portable toilets and sound stage equipment, the ACLU has said.",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",1

Relations between Ankara and Washington have been plagued by disputes over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, Turkey’s calls for the extradition of a U.S.-based cleric and the indictment of a Turkish former minister in a U.S. court. But last week’s arrest of a Turkish employee of the U.S. consulate in Istanbul marked a fresh low. Turkey said the employee had links to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for a failed military coup in July 2016. Gulen denies any connection with the coup. The U.S. embassy in Ankara condemned Ankara’s charges as baseless and announced on Sunday night it was halting all non-immigrant visa services in Turkey while it reassessed Turkey’s commitment to the security of its missions and staff. Within hours, Ankara announced it was taking the same measures against U.S. citizens seeking visas for Turkey. The U.S. ambassador said the duration of the visa services’ suspension would depend on talks between the two governments about the reasons for the detention of local staff in Turkey. In a written statement late on Monday, Ambassador John Bass said the length of the suspension would also depend on “the Turkish government’s commitment to protecting our facilities and personnel here in Turkey”. He noted that the move was not a visa ban on Turkish citizens, that valid visas could still be used and visa applications could be made outside of Turkey. The U.S. Embassy had been unable to learn the reasons for the arrest of its Turkish staff member last week or what evidence exists against the employee, Bass said, adding that he had not been allowed sufficient access to the employee’s lawyer. Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said that if Washington had serious security concerns about its missions in Turkey, steps would be taken to address them. “But if it’s an issue regarding the arrest of the consulate employee, then this is a decision the Turkish judiciary has made,” Gul told A Haber television. “Trying a Turkish citizen for a crime committed in Turkey is our right.” The Turkish foreign ministry summoned a U.S. diplomat to urge the United States to lift the visa services suspension, saying it was causing “unnecessary tensions”, and President Tayyip Erdogan also criticized the U.S. move. “For the (U.S.) embassy in Ankara to take such a decision and implement it, it is upsetting,” Erdogan told a news conference during a visit to Ukraine. State-run Anadolu news agency said another U.S. consulate worker had been summoned to testify over his wife and daughter’s suspected links to Gulen - which it said had emerged during the questioning of Metin Topuz, the employee arrested last week. The diplomatic spat spooked investors. The lira dropped 3.4 percent and stood at 3.7385 against the dollar after being quoted overnight as touching a level of 3.9223. The main BIST 100 stock index fell as much as 4.7 percent, closing the day down 2.73 percent at 101,298 points. Airline shares were particularly hard hit, with flag carrier Turkish Airlines falling 9 percent. The central bank said it was following developments closely. “This looks like a really serious situation,” said Blue Bay Asset Management strategist Timothy Ash. He added that the central bank would need to move quickly to calm market nerves and possibly hike interest rates - something Erdogan has resisted. Turkey’s leading business association, TUSIAD, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral economic, social and cultural ties, and called for disagreements to be settled calmly. The row with the United States coincides with deep strains in Turkey’s relations with Germany, another key ally, and with Turkish military activity at the Syrian and Iraqi borders, though their market impact has so far been limited. U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey. Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Gulen, viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup in which more than 240 people were killed.  Friction with the United States has also arisen from the indictment last month by a U.S. court of Turkey’s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan on charges of conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran. Sinan Ulgen, an analyst and former Turkish diplomat, said those underlying disputes had created a crisis of confidence which made this latest fall-out particularly bitter. “This harshness is a result of a build-up,” he said. “We should not consider this as solely a reaction to the detentions of consulate employees”.",politicsNews,"October 8, 2017 ",0
9134,TRUMP RUFFLES FEATHERS With New And Bold Presidential “Challenge” Coin,"Who knew that members of a presidential administration can have coins made to hand out.  Challenge coins  are given out and received by different people like first responders or the military . President Trump has the challenge coins he has received displayed in the Oval Office.Coin collector John Wertman shows his  very gold  Trump challenge coin:HOW THEY GOT THEIR START:Challenge coins got their start as military baubles bearing division insignia and presented by officers to troops for exemplary service. The moniker came from a tradition in which service members challenged one another to produce their coins. Those who did not have one had to buy a round of drinks.For two decades, the commander in chief has doled out distinguished-looking coins as personal mementos. Now, the presidential  challenge coin  has undergone a Trumpian transformation.The presidential seal has been replaced by an eagle bearing President Trump s signature. The eagle s head faces right, not left, as on the seal. The 13 arrows representing the original states have disappeared. And the national motto,  E pluribus unum    a Latin phrase that means  Out of many, one    is gone.Instead, both sides of the coin feature Trump s official campaign slogan,  Make America Great Again. The aide said the president, whose real estate properties are known for their gilded displays of wealth and status, was personally involved in redesigning the coin. Trump, who also had a hand in creating his famous red campaign hat,  wanted to weigh in on it,  the aide said.  It s beautifully made. FEATHERS RUFFLED: Ethics experts  are all aflutter because President Trump used his political slogan on the coin: For the commander in chief to give a political token with a campaign slogan on it to military officers would violate the important principle of separating the military from politics, as well as diminishing the tradition of the coin. There is also dispute about who pays for the coins. As it turns out, the Republican Party is paying for the coins.Yes, the coin is very gold and big but it is Trump s style. It s interesting to note the coins of Obama and Trump reflect each president.Read more: Boston Globe",politics,"Dec 23, 2017",0
19204,From nursery to university: Emerging market investors buy into education,"Two decades after Yusuf Karodia launched Mancosa, a distance learning school to teach South Africans business skills, he sold up to UK private equity firm Actis. From nurseries to exam tutoring and adult education, teaching businesses are booming as populations rise and cash-strapped governments fail to keep up with demand.  With 263 million children out of school worldwide, according to 2014 data from the United Nations, investors are keen to access a growing sector with few publicly-listed companies.  Karodia said Actis was one of a stream of interested private investors.    We had about an overture a week to partner with someone,  he told Reuters. Mancosa is now part of Actis s expanding higher education portfolio in Africa. It has spent $275 million since 2014, investing in education institutes across the continent which it groups under the brand name Honoris Universities and plans to list on a stock market in the next two to three years. Karodia, who will also get a stake in Honoris, says there is huge demand for education in Africa.    Quality education - especially coming from the private sector - is going to play an ever increasingly important role,  he said.  The International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity estimates that international financing for education in low- and middle-income countries will need to increase from today s estimated $16 billion per year to $89 billion by 2030. Jetilde Carlos is a 22-year old final year finance student at the Varsity College in Cape Town, owned by Johannesburg-listed ADvTECH Group. Carlos missed out on a place at a state university.  Its not that my parents had the money but they really wanted a better life for me. They didn t want me to sit at home looking for job when I might not even find one,  she said.  The degree is worth it in the end        Investors are keen for a slice of the market because the fee-paying structure guarantees a regular income stream. The sector is also relatively resilient to economic ups and downs as parents increasingly prioritize their children s education.   It goes with the whole consumer spending (trend) in emerging markets, and as income levels rise and there is more disposable income available what you re seeing is the population is looking to spend in areas such as education,  said Patricia Ribeiro, an equity portfolio manager at American Century Investments. Carlos paid a deposit of 25,000 rand ($1,876.38). If you pay up front the total is 70,500 rand but the monthly payments that she has chosen bring the total to about 90,000 rand for one year s tuition.  The sector is dominated by private equity players. MSCI s emerging equity index contains only three education stocks - New York-listed Chinese firms TAL and New Oriental Education and Brazil s Kroton.  Morgan Stanley describes shares in Chinese education operators as  attractive . China s education market catering for children from nursery to end of secondary school will grow 8 percent annually to become a 3 trillion yuan ($460 billion) market in 2020, the bank told clients.  Recent regulatory changes are set to benefit private tutoring firms, many of which prepare high-school pupils for university. TAL said in July that student enrolment was up more than 60 percent year-on-year, with a matching rise in revenue. Its stock has soared 180 percent since January. New Oriental Education projects revenue growth of as much as 24 percent in the three months to end-August. Its shares are up 114 percent since the start of 2017.  China is very exam-driven from kindergarten on and they are competing more and more with U.S. schools,  said Sandra Ackermann-Schaufler, senior portfolio manager for emerging markets at SEI.  If anyone thinks it s tough to get into U.S. universities they should look at the top Chinese universities....the growth you could see is explosive growth.  Valuations are soaring, possibly because fund managers are chasing too few companies. TAL s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is nearly 130, while New Oriental Education hovers around 50. In contrast, MSCI s emerging equity index trades at a P/E of around 12.   If you look at PE historically or if you look at PE this year, they look very expensive,  Julian Mayo, portfolio manager at Charlemagne Capital. Brazil became another destination for those seeking exposure to education stocks after 2009 when the government boosted loan programs for students attending for-profit colleges.  One of the main beneficiaries was Brazil s largest for-profit college operator Kroton Educacional.  While the recent recession in Latin America s biggest economy led to a fall in student loans, the biggest companies are already well-established, fund managers said.  Results published last month showed revenue growing near double-digits on the quarter, with gross margins well above 70 percent. Kroton s stock has risen more than 50 percent since the start of the year. The Gulf region also offers opportunities. Kuwait-based HumanSoft, which establishes and manages private universities and colleges listed in 2005.   United Arab Emirates-based GEMS Education, which operates more than 250 schools across 14 countries and counts Blackstone among its stakeholders, has indicated plans to list. In Africa, many governments want more private investors in education but they are approaching it cautiously. They want regulations in place to ensure the quality is high. Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi, Minister of International Affairs and Cooperation in Botswana said some young people had left private universities with certificates that  opened no doors . She said it was difficult to make sure  the people who are investing in education are not fraudsters, what we are finding is that some people are not there to deliver quality education.    We learned this very badly ourselves... but now people come in and invest, and this is taking a huge load off the government,  she said.",worldnews,"September 24, 2017 ",0
6047,Trump's top defense and homeland officials to attend Munich Security Conference,"U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Homeland Security chief John Kelly will attend the Munich Security Conference in February, and the event’s organizers said on Wednesday they expect other senior U.S. officials to attend also.  Mattis and Kelly were confirmed in their posts just days ago, following President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.  “All signs point to a particularly strong participation of both the new administration, as well as Congress,” the group said in a statement.     Bavarian state premier Horst Seehofer had invited Trump to visit Munich - and possibly the annual security conference - shortly after his election in November, although U.S. presidents have not attended the event in the past. U.S. vice presidents, by contrast, have frequently attended the annual event in Munich, which draws leaders and diplomats from Europe, the Middle East and the United States. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has been invited but it was not yet clear if he would attend, a spokesman said.  Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German envoy to Washington and the conference’s chairman, said participants would address issues such as the future of transatlantic relations, NATO and the EU, the Ukraine crisis, ties with Russia and the war in Syria. On Jan. 15, Trump said NATO was obsolete because it had not defended against terror attacks but that the military alliance was still very important to him. “I hope that we will not mince words and speak honestly about our disagreements as well as about our common interests and values,” Ischinger said in a statement. Other confirmed participants include U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, European Council President Donald Tusk, EU High Representative Federica Mogherini, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, the presidents of Poland, Ukraine, and Afghanistan, and the prime ministers of Norway, Hungary and Iraq. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will participate, as well as Sigmar Gabriel, who will take over as German foreign minister on Friday. Many business leaders, defense and foreign ministers, lawmakers and representatives of non-governmental organizations such as Human Rights Watch also take part.",politicsNews,"January 25, 2017 ",1

4485,EU official says no sign Trump plans to ease Russia sanctions,"A senior European Union official said on Tuesday he had seen no  sign that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration planned to lift sanctions on Russia over its activities in Ukraine, and warned that unilateral American sanctions on Russia could destabilize some European energy markets. “We have had no such indication,” David O’Sullivan, the head of the EU mission to the United States, told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on how the United States and EU could work together to push back against Russian aggression. “I think there is still remarkable unity of purpose between the United States and the European Union with regard to those issues,” O’Sullivan said. Allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian actors were behind the hacking of senior Democratic Party operatives and spreading disinformation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election have lingered over Trump’s tenure. Democrats charge the Russians wanted to tilt the election toward the Republican, who worried lawmakers from both parties during his campaign by calling for warmer relations with Russia. Trump has dismissed that claim, and Russia denies the allegations. During the hearing, Corker questioned the wisdom of legislation to impose more sanctions on Russia over its aggressive actions in Ukraine and Syria. Senator Ben Cardin, the foreign relations committee’s top Democrat, drafted such a bill earlier this year. It is sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans. Corker asked O’Sullivan whether it would be preferable for the United States to act unilaterally or work with the European Union on such sanctions. O’Sullivan said “close coordination” would be preferable. “We have moved in lockstep throughout this process and I think that has not only ensured of the right political response, but also the effectiveness of the sanctions,” O’Sullivan said. Some of the ideas that have been discussed could have a serious impact on the European energy sector, he said. “Many of our member states are heavily dependent upon imports from Russia and it would be very important not to destabilize that situation,” O’Sullivan said.  Cardin said some sanctions Europe has imposed on Russia are stronger those by the United States. “There may be some interest for us to try to pattern some of our sanctions on what Europe has already imposed on Russia,” he said.",politicsNews,"April 4, 2017 ",0
22617,THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL RACE: Do Our Votes Really Matter?,"By James PerloffMy friend Rachael McIntosh was an alternate delegate at the 2012 Republican Convention in Tampa, Florida, representing Ron Paul for the state of Rhode Island.Rachael had worked for a private defense contractor for years. Awakened by the corruption and darkness she witnessed, she left the defense industry, and began working tirelessly toward getting Ron Paul elected. She has fictionalized her experiences in a superbly written trilogy of novels, Security through Absurdity.The Tampa convention was supposed to begin on Monday, August 27. Ron Paul was originally slated to speak, but the convention was cancelled for that evening due to the threat of a  hurricane.  The hurricane turned out to be no more than a brisk rainstorm. Rachael and many other Ron Paul delegates braved it that morning and went to the convention center (the Tampa Bay Times Forum, a sports complex) to watch Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus officially proclaim the delay. After the gravel had been struck and the chairman left the stage, the delegates found themselves watching a movie glorifying Mitt Romney. At the film s conclusion, Rachael heard ear-splitting applause. But when she looked around, almost no one was cheering. The applause was  canned the type sports stadiums pipe in when the home team is losing and their spectators show low enthusiasm.The next day at her hotel, Rachael s husband called and said:  Hey, I watched it yesterday and the crowd was really diggin  Romney.  Rachael had to break the news: what he (and the rest of America) heard on TV had been faked.The real blow to the Ron Paul people came when the Republican National Committee made last-minute rule changes. Under the existing rules, Paul had won enough primaries and caucuses (five) to have his name placed in nomination. Under the newrules, the required number of states would be increased to eight, thus rendering Paul s nomination impossible. Mitt Romney, who had already won sufficient delegates through dirty tricks during the primaries to become the  presumptive nominee,  would also be granted power to replace duly elected delegates with people of his own choosing.Naturally, Paul s delegates were anxious to vote on the rule changes. However, the convention busses showed up at their hotels late. The driver of Rachael s bus didn t seem to know the way to the convention center, got stuck in traffic, and took about two hours to complete the trip. By the time most of the Paul delegates reached the center, and passed through its heavy security, the vote was already over. Mitt Romney would be the Republican Convention s  unanimous  choice.Ron Paul was still offered a chance to make a speech, but only under two conditions: (1) that he endorse Romney; and (2) that the Republic National Committee first vet and approve the speech. Under these conditions, Paul acted on integrity and declined to speak.A word should be added about the media in Tampa. On the convention s last day, Rachael dressed up in funeral black and handed out cards offering condolences to America upon the loss of the democratic process. She gave one to a leading news journalist who said  I love it.  When Rachael asked if he would do a story on it, he literally replied:  It doesn t fit the pre-scripted narrative. Sorry. That the media was bound to a  pre-scripted narrative  was later proven when a brawl broke out between the Romney and Paul delegates, complete with screaming, pushing and shoving, right by the entrance to the press boxes (CNN, Fox, MSNBC, etc.). Although the brawl should have been  news,  not a single journalist emerged with a camera to record it. After all, it didn t fit the  pre-scripted narrative namely, that Republicans unanimously supported Mitt Romney.What lesson can we draw from Rachael s experience? The same one that people have been learning the hard way for decades: that regardless of much you work for a Presidential candidate, the PTB (Powers That Be) will railroad their candidate to the top. The following quote from my 1988 book The Shadows of Power refers to the election year of 1952:At the Republican nominating convention,  dirty tricks  abounded. The rules for selecting delegates were changed: Taft delegations from Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas were thrown out and replaced by Eisenhower supporters. I.e., the same sort of tactics that Ron Paul s supporters faced in 2012 were used at the GOP Convention 60 years earlier. I ll add that Dwight Eisenhower had no previous affiliation with the Republican Party; the Democratic Party had tried to draft him in 1948, and President Harry Truman (Democrat) had approached him about running on the same ticket. Above: Nixon and Eisenhower at the 1952 conventionLet s kick it back to 1940. Seven weeks before the GOP Convention, a poll showed only three percent of Republicans favored candidate Wendell Willkie, who, prior to that year, had been a registered Democrat. But with powerful magic, Willkie got the nomination. Ten-term Congressman Usher Burdick of North Dakota said of this:We Republicans in the west want to know if Wall Street and the international bankers control our party and can select our candidate? I believe I am serving the best interests of the Republican Party by protesting and exposing the machinations and attempts of J.P. Morgan and the New York utility bankers in forcing Wendell Willkie on the Republican Party. . . .There is nothing to the Willkie boom for President except the artificial public opinion being created by newspapers, magazines, and the radio. The reason back of all this is money. Money is being spent by someone, and lots of it. PHOTO: Wendell Willkie PHOTO: Usher Burdick (right) in 1958 with Ezra PoundFor those who wonder if such phenomena only happen to Republicans, Bernie Sanders can already  feel the spurn.  He won New Hampshire by a landslide (60 to 38 percent) only to discover that Hillary Clinton had been awarded the majority of delegates. This is because the Democratic Party has 717  superdelegates  who support whomever they prefer, regardless of the wishes of voters or primary results.Go back to 1976. According to a Gallup poll, just seven months before the Democratic National Convention, less than four percent of Democratic voters favored Jimmy Carter for President. What happened? As Lawrence Shoup noted in The Carter Presidency and Beyond:What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media. It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months.How did Carter acquire this media following? It began at a dinner with Republican David Rockefeller  kingmaker of the Establishment at the latter s Tarrytown, New York estate. Also present was Zbigniew Brzezinski, who helped Rockefeller found the internationalist Trilateral Commission, and whom Carter would later appoint National Security Adviser. The media blitz included adulatory pieces in the New York Times, and a Wall Street Journal editorial declaring that Carter was the best Democratic candidate. Before the nominating convention, his picture appeared on the cover of Time three times, and Newsweek twice. Time s cover artists were even instructed to make him look as much as possible like John F. Kennedy. The TV networks inundated the public with his image.As former Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater said:David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski found Jimmy Carter to be their ideal candidate. They helped him win the nomination and the presidency. To accomplish this purpose, they mobilized the money power of the Wall Street bankers, the intellectual influence of the academic community   which is subservient to the wealth of the great tax-free foundations   and the media controllers represented in the membership of the CFR and the Trilateral.If you want to glimpse how far back this sort of power-brokering goes, read Ferdinand Lundberg s 1937 classic America s Sixty Families. He related how, a century ago, the rich were scorning voters and maneuvering their own choices into nominations, whether a Democrat like Woodrow Wilson in 1912 or a Republican like Herbert Hoover in 1928.The 2016 RaceWhat about this year? Who have the  PTB  anointed to become President? While I am of course not privy to their conclaves, I believe their chosen one, as I stated in my blog post of February 15, is Hillary Clinton. There are several indicators:(1) Despite her  anti-Wall Street  rhetoric, Hillary receives by far the most donations from Wall Street of any candidate. Jeb Bush competed with her for that distinction, but since Jeb s personality proved too lackluster to muster enough votes to stay in the race, Hillary holds the honor alone. Above: Hillary partakes in groundbreaking ceremony for Goldman Sachs  new headquarters in 2005. (2) Of the viable candidates, only Hillary is committed to 100 percent of the Rothschild agenda:  pro  War on Terror    pro Israel   pro gun control   pro GMO (Monsanto)   pro population control (abortion, vaccines, etc.)   pro  climate change  control   pro mass immigration   pro Internet censorship   pro gay agenda   pro TPP (she is currently backing off on this because of voter concern about jobs, but before running she said  This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements, and was a strong proponent of the job-destroying NAFTA and GATT agreements)(3) I ll interject here that Rachael McIntosh told me she believes that in 2008, an understanding was reached concerning Obama and Clinton, both of whom were running that year. Obama would become the first black President; Hillary s turn would arrive in due time, and she would become the first woman President. Having a black or woman in the Oval Office, of course, gives the public the illusion that they are  empowered  and that the Establishment has somehow been stymied, whereas in fact both Obama and Hillary are flunkies for the Establishment. I agree with Rachael s assessment 100 percent.And so it was that Obama appointed Hillary his Secretary of State, a move clearly intended to give her a  foreign policy expertise  credential for the 2016 Presidential campaign. After Clinton left the position (2013), CBS began airing (2014) its still-running drama Madam Secretary, all about a blonde woman Secretary of State. Subliminal Advertising: Hollywood began campaigning for Hillary Clinton in 2014.  Beginning with the very first episode, in which  Madam Secretary  rescued American hostages held in Syria, viewers would receive a weekly dose of subliminal propaganda for Hillary s campaign, portraying her as beautiful, heroic, honest and competent.(4) Prior to being Secretary of State, Hillary served as U.S. Senator from New York. She had never lived in New York before, but the state is the center of America s banking industry, and has been a launching point for Presidential candidates such as the Roosevelts. Serving a Senate term, of course, would also give Hillary an important  can work with Congress  credential for her Presidential run. There is considerable Internet buzz that John F. Kennedy, Jr., who had long lived in New York, was planning to run for the Senate in 2000, the same year as Clinton. The handsome son of the popular President would likely have defeated Clinton, adding interest to Kennedy s death in a suspicious plane crash on July 16, 1999, especially in light of what has been termed the Clinton Body Count.(5) Perhaps most importantly, the Establishment has already marked Hillary with their stamp of approval by entrusting her with two terms in the White House. Yes, Bill Clinton was President then, but if Hillary is elected, Bill will of course be returning.Will the email or Benghazi scandals derail her Presidential bid? I doubt it. During Bill s tenure, the Clintons were plagued by innumerable scandals besides mysterious deaths: sex charges, perjury, Whitewater,  Chinagate,   Travelgate,  drug allegations connected with his Arkansas governorship, Hillary s incredible cattle futures profits, etc. Yet although many pundits back then claimed these scandals would lead to impeachment, the Clintons always remained untouched by justice. So far, nothing seems to have changed. However, Hillary s scandals do give the Establishment a blackmailer s leash on her; i.e., if she ever steps out of line, prosecutions could suddenly materialize.What about the other candidates currently running? All of them share some of Hillary s positions, but none do 100 percent. Bernie Sanders is too opposed to banker bailouts to be acceptable, even though the Establishment is OK with his socialism (since, in an illusional democracy, empowering government empowers them). Cruz s wife Heidi is a former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a vice president at Goldman Sachs, from whom Cruz s Senate campaign received a million-dollar loan; but his positions on matters like abortion, gun control and immigration don t pass muster Continue this story at James PerloffREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",US_News,"March 22, 2016",0

11812,Myanmar military appoints general to probe mass grave in Rakhine state,"Myanmar s army said on Wednesday that it had appointed a senior officer to investigate whether any members of the security forces were involved in the killing of 10 people whose bodies have been uncovered in a mass grave in Rakhine State. A violent crackdown by the security forces in response to attacks by militants in the western state has caused around 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh in recent months. The discover of the grave, at the village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of the state capital Sittwe, was announced by the military two days ago. In a statement posted on the Facebook page of the military s commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the army said a five-member investigation team had left the capital Naypyitaw on Wednesday. The team, led by Lieutenant General Aye Win, would  investigate whether the security forces took part or not, in relation to the unidentified dead bodies found in Inn Din village graveyard . It gave no further details and military officials were not immediately available for comment. General Aye Win is the same officer who led a wider probe into the conduct of troops in a conflict that began in late August, which concluded in a report last month that no atrocities took place. Myanmar s armed forces launched what they termed clearance operations in northern Rakhine, where many of the stateless Muslim minority lived, after Rohingya militants attacked 30 police posts and an army base on Aug. 25. Rights monitors have accused troops of abuses, including killings, mass rape and arson during those operations. The United States has said it amounted to  ethnic cleansing . Myanmar s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced fierce international criticism for failing to do more to protect the Rohingya. The civilian government, which has no control over the military, has said the army was engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations. It has promised to investigate allegations of abuses in Rakhine if it is given evidence.",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",0

They quoted Politico:  Trump transition members were under surveillance during Obama administration.  And they quoted Nunes:  Members of the Donald Trump transition team, possibly including Trump himself, were under surveillance during the Obama administration following November s election. Here s the full letter:Whoa. as flagged by the DCCC, Republicans are now fundraising on the false claim that Obama spied on Trump pic.twitter.com/AKzw3jAAQJ  Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) March 23, 2017Is there context? Of course not. That s nonexistent in their letter, but here s some: The quote from the Politico story is the caption on top of the video they posted of Nunes  press conference. And here s some more relevant context from that story: Nunes set off the firestorm with a news conference earlier in the day in which he described the surveillance of Trump aides through what s called  incidental collection,  something he noted was routine and legal. Such collection can occur when a person inside the United State communicates with a foreign target of U.S. surveillance. In such cases, the identities of U.S. citizens are supposed to be shielded   but can be  unmasked  by intelligence officials under certain circumstances. Furthermore, Nunes himself said: This is a normal, incidental collection, based on what I could collect. It alarms him anyway, for some reason.However, more significant than that is the fact that Nunes also said yesterday that he still has no evidence Trump, his team, or his campaign were wiretapped or otherwise the target of surveillance by the Obama administration. None. Zero, zip, zilch, nada.  I have said this for many, many weeks,  he told White House reporters.What we have now is a party that s actively and knowingly spreading Trump s lies to gain an edge they know they re losing. Should investigations conclude that not only did a sitting president level a demonstrably false accusation against his predecessor, but also that he colluded with Russia during the election cycle, the GOP is sunk.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"March 23, 2017",1
3349,WATCH: Fox Panel Pretends Republicans Never Treated The Obama Family Like Sh*t,"Anybody who says conservatives always treated the Obama family with dignity and respect deserve to be smacked HARD to jog their memory.Because ever since Donald Trump was elected, conservatives have been insisting that we should all unite behind him and treat him with nothing but respect because that s how they treated President Obama.Except that s not how they treated President Obama at all. For eight years, conservatives have called him and his family every name in the book, particularly favoring the N-word. They also vowed to sabotage his presidency from the very first day. But they have the gall to call for everyone to give Trump a chance even though they never gave Obama a chance.And the complete disrespect of our current president continued during a discussion on Fox Business, which was about Michelle Obama s interview with Oprah Winfrey expressing the feeling of hopelessness that has engulfing millions of Americans since since the results came in on Election Day.Of course, Fox host Maria Bartiromo and her right-wing guests attacked Mrs. Obama, with Morgan Ortagus literally demanding her to shut up and smile. You could really hear the disdain in her voice,  Ortagus opined.  People need to understand the American people spoke, the Electoral College voted and it s time to move on. And the American people actually decided that it was a repudiation of the past eight years of the type of presidency that Barack Obama [had] and the policies he s ensued [sic]. But the American people voted for Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes so this election was definitely not a repudiation of President Obama. It was a demonstration of Russian power to meddle in our political process. Also, President Obama has a higher approval rating than Trump.But Ortagus continued to whine. You didn t hear Laura Bush saying anything eight years ago. She was gracious, she was classy, she was warm and welcoming to the new first family. And I think that Ms. Obama needs to take a cue from Laura Bush and probably just smile and be helpful to Melania Trump. Kevin Kelly then chimed in by accusing everyone who have lost hope of being lazy moochers who rely on government for everything.Ortagus agreed and then treated Michelle Obama as if she s  the help. What really just irked me about the interview is I thought it was really inappropriate. If I were in her position, I would think she should be helping the incoming first lady, the incoming administration. It s a huge transition for the first family. Melania Trump has a young son, she had young children. Let s focus on the positive and help the new first family transition. It doesn t feel like the other side understands or really cares what the American people just voted for,  Bartiromo said.Here s the video via YouTube.Again, Donald Trump LOST the popular vote, so the American people voted AGAINST him. Furthermore, President Obama won both of his elections by far wider margins but conservatives didn t care abut how the American people voted in 2008 or in 2012. They treated the Obamas like shit, and even attacked their young children and continue to do so today. So they have no right to whine about how people are treating Donald Trump. Turnabout is fair play, and Democrats should treat Trump the same way conservatives treated Obama.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"December 19, 2016",0
4319,"Trump to meet U.S. business leaders on infrastructure, tax reform","U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with about 20 chief executives on Tuesday as he works to gain support for a $1 trillion infrastructure program, tax reform and other administration priorities, said White House spokesman Sean Spicer. Trump will meet with the heads of General Motors Co (GM.N), International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), a government official briefed on the matter said. Trump has pledged to unlock $1 trillion in private and public infrastructure investments to fix bridges, improve the electrical grid and broadband internet, modernize airports and potentially rebuild hospitals for veterans. Nearly three months after his inauguration, Trump will again seek the advice and funds of the private sector for his “national rebuilding” program. Trump also wants to streamline the income tax system, cut federal regulations, reduce corporate income tax and add new taxes to prod companies to keep or move production to the United States. He has held numerous sessions with CEOs since taking office. The chief executives are part of Trump’s “Strategy and Policy Forum” that was created in December and last met with the president on Feb. 3. The business leaders from a variety of sectors will also meet in small groups with Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, Spicer said. Participants in Ross’ meeting include Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon and Indra Nooyi, chief executive officer of PepsiCo Inc PEP.N. Pruitt’s meeting will include GM CEO Mary Barra and Paul Atkins, CEO of Patomak Global Partners LLC and a Republican former SEC commissioner. Chao’s meeting will include Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who heads the world’s largest investment management firm, in a letter to shareholders Monday backed calls for private investment to rebuild U.S. infrastructure. The Trump administration plans to unveil as soon as May the $1 trillion infrastructure plan over 10 years. “Fixing crumbling roads and bridges is not enough. We need to be focused on reshaping our world, not just repairing it,” Fink wrote. Last week, Trump pitched infrastructure projects to about 50 New York area CEOs. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn told executives that privatizing air traffic control, which the administration proposed in its budget outline in March, could be a big boost. Other chief executives taking part Tuesday include consultant EY, Boston Consulting Group, the Cleveland Clinic and Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure investment fund.",politicsNews,"April 10, 2017 ",0
9615,LAWYER FOR FBI INFORMANT: My Client Knows What Russians Were Saying During Bribery of Clintons [VIDEO],"The lawyer for the FBI informant under a gag order that prevents him from going before Congress spoke out about what s to come with the Clinton/Russia Uranium story:Fox Business reported: An informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is under a gag order that prevents him from testifying before the United States Congress that Russian nuclear officials were involved in fraudulent dealings in 2009 before the Uranium One deal was approved.Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch blocked the informant from testifying last year and threatened criminal action against him if he were to do so.In an interview with FOX Business  Lou Dobbs, Victoria Toensing, the attorney representing the FBI informant, said she has never heard of a criminal penalty for breaching a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). If it does and it is unconstitutional and it s invalid, if it prohibits my client from giving information to the legislature, the executive cannot say to people,  Hey, you can t give information to another body of the government,  Toensing said.KEY POINTS: The Republican leadership was blocking the investigation into both Benghazi and the Russia uranium scandal involving Clinton.Senator Grassley called on Sessions to release the info on the gag order by November 1st This should be interesting.The NDA (gag order) is unconstitutional and Toensing says this type of gag order has a criminal penalty.

14901,"Strong earthquake hits Iraq and Iran, killing more than 450","Thousands of homeless Iranians huddled against the cold late on Monday, a day after at least 450 people were killed in Iran s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade, state TV said. Rescue teams kept up search operations for dozens trapped beneath the rubble of collapsed houses in towns and villages in the mountainous area of the western province of Kermanshah that borders Iraq.   Iran s English-language Press TV said more than 450 people were killed and 7,000 were injured when the magnitude 7.3 earthquake jolted the country on Sunday. Local officials expected the death toll to climb as search and rescue teams reached remote areas of Iran.  The quake was felt in several provinces of Iran but the hardest hit province was Kermanshah. More than 300 of the victims were in Sarpol-e Zahab county in that province, about 15 km (10 miles) from the Iraq border.  Iranian state television said the quake had caused heavy damage in some villages where houses were made of earthen bricks. The quake also triggered landslides that hindered rescue efforts, officials told state television.  At least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected, Iranian media reported. Iranian media reported that a woman and her baby were pulled out alive from the rubble on Monday in Sarpol-e Zahab, the worst hit area with a population of 85,000. Relief workers said while much aid had been pledged, there was an immediate need for blankets, children s clothes, medicine and large cans to store drinking water. TV aired footage of some people weeping next to corpses shrouded in blankets. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences on Monday, urging all government agencies to do all they could to help those affected. State TV appealed for blood donations. The government announced one day mourning on Tuesday.  Tempers frayed in the quake-hit area as the search went on for survivors amidst the twisted rubble of collapsed buildings. State TV aired footage of damaged buildings, vehicles under rubble and wounded people wrapped in blankets.  We need a shelter,  a middle-aged man in Sarpol-e Zahab told state TV.  Where is the aid? Where is the help?  His family could not spend another night outside in cold weather, he said.     An Iraqi meteorology official put the quake s magnitude at 6.5, with the epicenter in Penjwin in Iraq s Sulaimaniyah province in the Kurdistan region, close to the main border crossing with Iran. Kurdish health officials said at least six people were killed in Iraq and at least 68 injured, adding that in northern Iraq Kurdish districts seven were killed and 325 wounded. Iraq s health and local officials said the worst-hit area was Darbandikham district, near the border with Iran, where at least 10 houses had collapsed and the district s only hospital was severely damaged.  The situation there is very critical,  Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed told Reuters. The district s main hospital was damaged and had no power, Rasheed said, so the injured were taken to Sulaimaniyah for treatment. Homes and buildings had extensive structural damage, he said.  The quake was felt as far south as Baghdad, where many residents rushed from their houses and tall buildings when tremors shook the Iraqi capital.  I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,  said Majida Ameer. who ran out of her building with her three children.   I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming:  Earthquake!  An Iranian local official told state TV that some villages were totally destroyed.   I lost nine members of my family ... they were killed while they slept,  a weeping middle-aged woman told state TV.      Local officials said hundreds of critically wounded people had been transferred to other provinces as Kermanshah s main hospital had been badly damaged.  Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. A magnitude 6.6 quake on Dec. 26, 2003, devastated the historic city of Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran, killing about 31,000 people. Electricity and water was cut off in several Iranian and Iraqi cities, and fears of aftershocks sent thousands of people in both countries out onto the streets and parks in cold weather. Across the area, rescue workers and special teams using sniffer dogs and heat sensors searched wreckage. Blocked roads made it hard for rescue workers to reach some remote villages.  Iranian authorities acknowledged the relief effort was still slow and patchy. More than 70,000 people needed emergency shelter, the head of Iranian Red Crescent said. Hojjat Gharibian, one of hundreds of homeless Iranian survivors, was huddled against the cold with his family in Qasr-e Shirin.   My two children were sleeping when the house started to collapse because of the quake. I took them and ran to the street. We spent hours in the street until aid workers moved us into a school building,  Gharibian told Reuters by telephone.   Iran s police, Revolutionary Guards and Basij militia forces were sent to quake-hit areas overnight, state TV reported. Aid workers handed out water to people, while bulldozers worked to clear the streets in damaged areas.  A local official said aftershocks slowed down erecting tents for homeless people but electricity had been restored in most of the quake-hit areas.    The main problem is sheltering people at this cold weather. We need more tents,  Qasr-e Shririn governor Faramarz Akbari told TV.",worldnews,"November 12, 2017 ",0

6141,Republican Budget Cuts Could Shut Down Every Public School In Kansas,"Kansas  school system has been in considerable trouble ever since the state s Republican government decided to slash funding and change how money was distributed, which badly shortchanged poorer schools. Of course, Kansas Republicans didn t really seem to care until they were sued, and the case went to the state s supreme court. The court ordered them to fix the situation, and we re just certain they put forth their best effort, but the so-called  changes  resulted in no change at all for most schools.After reviewing the plan, the Kansas Supreme Court rejected parts of the plan, saying: Disparities among the districts remain inequitable and unconstitutional. If the legislature doesn t fix the problem in a way that makes funding fairer for the poorer districts by June 30, the court has ordered that all schools will remain closed until the funding problem is resolved.Governor Sam Brownback swept into office with grandiose promises about how tax cuts and budget cuts would result in businesses just flocking to the state, which, in turn would actually increase revenue for the state. The education funding crisis began after the GOP legislature and Brownback cut the state s education budget last year, after Brownback s promises of business windfalls failed to materialize.That s typical Republican thinking   these things never work that way. They live in denial, though.Last year, six districts had to close before the official end of the year because their funding had run out. Fortunately, they d already held enough days of school to still comply with the law, but they had to look for ways to tighten their belts without laying off teachers, which was quite painful for them.All the state legislature did to address the problem was reshuffle dollars around, but didn t increase education funding overall. According to U.S. News & World Report: Because the plan guarantees that no district loses any aid it already has been promised for the next school year, most of them  including the four suing the state   would see no change in their aid overall. Twenty-three would see small increases, covered by the state tapping an existing pot of emergency school aid. Forget Kansas  students. Forget producing graduates that can help take the state and the country into the future. Cutting government spending is Republican dogma. They don t care who they hurt, even if it means hurting children and the education they re entitled to under their state s constitution.Featured image by Gage Skidmore.

19013,"Pakistan's ex-PM Sharif appears before anti-corruption court, set to be indicted","Ousted Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif appeared before an anti-corruption court on Tuesday, kicking off trial proceedings that he says are biased and which threaten to dent his party s chances at the next general election due in mid-2018. Sharif briefly appeared before a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) court in Islamabad on three corruption charges. He did not enter a plea. Local TV channels reported that Sharif is scheduled to be formally indicted on Oct. 2, about two months after his disqualification by the Supreme Court for not declaring a small source of income that he denied receiving.  A Supreme Court panel has also alleged Sharif family s wealth far exceeds their legal income.  He has appeared before the court and by appearing he has proved to be a lion,  said Marvi Memom, a lawmaker for Sharif s ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)party. Sharif, who returned from London on Monday after about a month in Britain, told the court his wife was being treated for cancer in London and needs his care. He did not speak to the media after his court appearance but is due to hold a televised press conference at 3pm (6.00 a.m. ET). Sharif has portrayed the corruption claims against him as politically motivated, while his allies, including daughter and heir-apparent Maryam, have hinted Pakistan s powerful military had a hand in his toppling. The military denies any such action.  It s a good thing that finally NAB and such institutions are holding rich and powerful to the count,  said Shafqat Mahmood, a senior members of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. PTI, led by cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan who doggedly pushed the Supreme Court into launching a corruption probe into Sharif, has called for an early election but it is unlikely the government will agree to that. Sharif s returned to Pakistan quashed growing speculation that his long absence was the start of another period in exile for the veteran leader whose three stints as prime minister were all cut short, including one by a military coup in 1999.  What kind of justice is this, what kind of accountability is this?  Sharif told reporters outside his upscale London apartment in London before departing for Islamabad on Sunday. Two of Sharif s sons are also due to appear before a NAB court, as well as Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, a long-time ally who is married into the Sharif family. Analysts say Sharif s return to Pakistan was in large part due to fears of defections within the PML-N, a common occurrence in a nation where politicians switch allegiances ahead of polls depending on which way the political winds are blowing. Sharif kept control of PML-N after his ouster and installed loyalist Shahid Khaqan Abbasi as prime minister. The Supreme Court has told the NAB courts that the trials into the Sharifs must be over within six months, with opponents betting that a flow of negative news from the trials will hurt PML-N s popularity ahead at the next election.",worldnews,"September 26, 2017 ",1
2378,"New York, New Jersey governors replace Port Authority leadership","New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said on Tuesday they will replace two top executives at the powerful bi-state agency that controls many of the region’s most critical transportation assets. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Executive Director Pat Foye, whom Cuomo appointed to the authority in 2011, and Chairman John Degnan, whom Christie appointed in 2014, are leaving. The shakeup comes amid a struggle to find a chief executive officer. This is a new position created under reforms intended to clean up the agency after the “Bridgegate” scandal raised questions of political meddling. Resuming the CEO search will be “one of the first priorities” for the incoming officers, Cuomo and Christie said in a joint statement. Replacing Foye is Rick Cotton, Cuomo’s special counsel since January 2015 who has overseen some of the governor’s highest profile infrastructure projects. Those projects include a replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge, a $4 billion public-private partnership to renovate LaGuardia Airport’s central terminal and the transformation of an historic post office into a grand waiting hall for Pennsylvania Station, the busiest transport hub in the nation. Tapped to lead the board is Kevin O’Toole, a lawyer, Christie ally and former long-time state senator who joined the board in March. O’Toole and Cotton are expected to be sworn in at a special meeting of the Port Authority board on Thursday. The authority has been slow to fully adopt governance changes after the Bridgegate controversy. In 2013, a former Port Authority executive, David Wildstein, shut down lanes at the George Washington Bridge to cause massive traffic jams as punishment for a local mayor who declined to support Christie’s gubernatorial re-election bid. In his resignation letter to Christie on Tuesday, Chairman Degnan said he was “disappointed” that the CEO position has not yet been implemented. He highlighted changes including posting board meeting agendas and materials online well in advance, allowing the public to comment before board votes, and new guidelines on recusals and oversight. Degnan had championed a replacement for the authority’s crumbling 42nd Street bus terminal in Manhattan, helping to secure about $3.5 billion for the project in the authority’s latest capital plan. Degnan told Reuters in an email that he did not have specific plans other to “increase my attention to nonprofit boards I sit on and watch my grandchildren grow up.”",politicsNews,"August 1, 2017 ",0

11092,IS FOX ABOUT TO BECOME CNN? Leftist Wives Of Liberal Murdoch Sons Blamed For Firing Of Bill O’Reilly…TRASH Trump On Social Media,"It is difficult to exaggerate the significance of Fox News sacking of Bill O Reilly.Not only was he the single most dominant public figure in America s vast conservative media environment, his removal signals the growing power of James and Lachlan Murdoch in the world s most powerful media empire, their father Rupert Murdoch s 21st Century Fox.O Reilly was dismissed overnight following allegations of sexual harassment by at least six women. It has been reported that Lachlan s wife Sarah Murdoch helped influence the decision. Last year the former Fox News creator, Roger Ailes, was sacked in similar circumstances, going on to advise Donald Trump s presidential campaign.O Reilly has been a towering figure in American politics and culture since Murdoch and Ailes began to build the conservative Fox News channel and its identity around him in 1996. His evening talk program, The O Reilly Factor, was combative and trenchantly conservative, setting the tone for the entire channel, which soon came to dominate cable news and, in turn, the entire American news landscape. In January 2014, Fox News marked its 145th consecutive month as the No.1 rated cable news channel in the US. Sydney Morning HeraldJames Murdoch s wife works for the Clinton Climate Initiative. She is an outspoken hater of President Trump on Twitter and much of her hate is directed at his refusal to accept that man-made climate warming cooling change is settled science. Here are a few examples of the hate she spews for Donald Trump on Twitter:Clean energy jobs for many Americans or dirty energy money for a few polluters- this shouldn't be a hard choice. https://t.co/pdX6CPEYJm  Kathryn Murdoch (@KathrynAMurdoch) April 19, 2017Enough of President Bannon. President Jarvanka preferable.  Kathryn Murdoch (@KathrynAMurdoch) April 5, 2017""An angry reflex in search of an idea"" sums up a lot https://t.co/sof1ZB4paw  Kathryn Murdoch (@KathrynAMurdoch) March 28, 2017Bill O Reilly spent a considerable amount of time on his top rated show debunking phony man-made climate-change. Hmmm could there be a connection the #1 host on Fox News who had the ability to influence millions of people and his firing?New York Magazine s Gabriel Sherman, who has broken a string of stories about the changing of the guard inside Fox, wrote that, as allegations mounted against O Reilly, Rupert Murdoch wanted to stand by the host, while Lachlan and James wanted to sack him.The Murdochs  decision to dump O Reilly shocked many Fox News staffers I ve spoken to in recent days. Late last week, the feeling inside the company was that Rupert Murdoch would prevail over his son James, who lobbied to jettison the embattled host. It s still unclear exactly how the tide turned. According to one source, Lachlan Murdoch s wife helped convince her husband that O Reilly needed to go, which moved Lachlan into James s corner. The source added that senior executives at other divisions within the Murdoch empire have complained that if O Reilly s allegations had happened to anyone else at their companies, that person would be gone already.Has it actually been proven that Bill O Reilly is guilty or is America to believe that just because Rupert Murdoch s liberal sons (and/or their wives) want O Reilly gone that he is indeed guilty?Hollywood Reporter   Last July, after Gretchen Carlson sued the Murdoch-controlled 21st Century Fox and Roger Ailes, the then-head of Fox News Channel, for sexual harassment, Rupert Murdoch told his sons, both Ailes enemies, that paying off Carlson without a fight would mean more lawsuits. Easy-money settlements always bring more claims. James and Lachlan Murdoch, however, were eager to get rid of their nemesis, and the most direct way to do that was to accept Carlson s claims after a quickie investigation and then use a big payoff   $20 million   to end the dispute and calm the storm.Nine months later, the chickens coming home to roost, Fox has continued to collect a string of look-alike claims against Ailes and against ratings giant Bill O Reilly, with a firestorm of recent press attention on what The New York Times is calling the  O Reilly revelations.  What has been revealed is not evidence nor an admission of guilt but details of payments settling complaints against O Reilly   not a small distinction. You can assume maximal guilt, which the Times and other Fox haters do, or you can assume, as many lawyers do, that when there is money to be had, plaintiffs come out of the woodwork. ( Coming out of the woodwork  is a virtual term of art in big settlement tort cases).Murdoch Senior is said to be saying,  I told you so.  James, CEO of 21st Century Fox, is blaming it on the Fox News culture and has hired Paul Weiss, the same law firm that performed a two-week investigation of Ailes, to probe O Reilly (there is, too, a Department of Justice investigation of how settlement payments were made, which Rupert dismisses as DOJ liberal politics and which his sons see as indicating more Fox News dark arts). This is a reflection of greater family and company interests and conflicts. For 86-year-old Rupert, Fox News is a key part of his legacy, as well as the family company s health: the most profitable news outlet ever ($1.5 billion in profits this year) and among the most influential. For James, 44, and Lachlan, 45, the hope is to reshape this legacy, to move Fox away from what they see as its retro, Trump-style views toward, well, something nicer (and to do this profitably, they hope, somehow).It s a particular sort of irony that Fox, which, to the delight of its audience, built itself on rejecting liberal assumptions, might now be brought down by such a signature liberal assumption: Where there are charges of sexual harassment, there is sexual harassment. It s a kind of zeitgeist power play. After President Trump went out of his way to support O Reilly on April 5, The New York Times, which left little doubt that it accepted the truth of the allegations, noted  the president has a particular rapport with Mr. O Reilly, whose hectoring braggadocio and no-apologies nostalgia for a bygone American era mirror Mr. Trump s own. This is a curious view considering Trump won the presidency, and O Reilly is the highest-rated cable news host and, to boot, one of the best-selling authors in the country. So, more accurately, it may only be a bygone era for The New York Times and the liberal order that so furiously opposes and links Trump and Fox.

The Murdoch sons, while in important ways financially supported by the profitable, culturally backward views at Fox, see their job as taking the company into a new era.The sons  plan was to make Fox the network of Megyn Kelly rather than of Ailes and O Reilly. That plan foundered on widespread resentment at the network toward Kelly for her part in Ailes  ouster and on the election of Trump.

19749,Turkey starts trial of 30 newspaper staff for links to coup attempt,"Thirty journalists and newspaper executives from a Turkish newspaper which was shut down last year went on trial on Monday, facing life sentences over charges that they had links to a failed coup attempt. The former employees of the Zaman newspaper are charged with  membership of an armed terror organization  and  attempting to overthrow  the government, parliament and the constitutional order through their links to cleric Fethullah Gulen. Zaman was affiliated with Gulen, the U.S.-based cleric and former ally of President Tayyip Erdogan. Gulen is blamed by Ankara for instigating the failed July 2016 coup, but denies any involvement. Zaman was first seized by the Turkish government in March 2016, months before the coup attempt, and then closed down by a government decree. Twenty-two of the suspects have been in pre-trial detention for months, including 73-year-old columnist Sahin Alpay.  If it had ever crossed my mind that the Gulenist movement would take a role in a coup attempt, I would never have written a column in the Zaman newspaper,  Dogan news agency quoted Alpay as saying. The indictment calls for three consecutive life sentences for the Zaman staff on charges of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, the Turkish parliament and the Turkish government, and says the newspaper had exceeded the limits of press freedom and freedom of expression.  I accept that this is an armed terrorist organization, but I was never a member of it,  columnist Ali Bulac told the court in Silivri, the site of a large prison about 60 km (40 miles) west of the city. He had not paid close attention to the Gulenist movement s activities, he said.   I missed the hole in the ground when I was watching the stars. But who did see it?,  Bulac said, adding the group s operations were perceived to be legal during the time he worked for Zaman. Turkey s Justice Ministry announced in July that more than 50,000 people had been arrested and 169,013 have been the subject of legal proceedings since the coup attempt.  The scale of the crackdown has drawn criticism from Turkey s Western allies and led German Chancellor Angela Merkel to call for Ankara s European Union accession talks to be called off. Turkey says the sweeping response to the coup reflects the deep security challenges the country has faced.  Rights groups say more than 160 journalists are detained in Turkey, making it the world s biggest jailer of journalists. The hearing will continue this week.",worldnews,"September 18, 2017 ",1
15384,Judge orders Rosneft CEO Sechin to appear as witness in bribery case,"A Russian judge on Wednesday ordered Igor Sechin, the head of Russian oil giant Rosneft and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, to appear as a witness in the bribery trial of former economy minister Alexei Ulyukayev. Ulyukayev was dismissed and put under house arrest a year ago over allegations that he took a $2 million bribe from Rosneft. He denies the charges. RIA news agency quoted a court secretary as saying the hearing where Sechin would testify would take place on Monday, Nov. 13. Rosneft declined to comment. Ulyukayev, who has already accused Sechin in court of framing him, was detained on Nov. 14 last year at Rosneft s Moscow headquarters, moments after Sechin handed him the cash in a late-night meeting that, according to prosecutors, was designed to catch the minister in the act of accepting a bribe. Analysts say the case is politically charged because Sechin represents a powerful faction in the Kremlin which favors greater state control over the economy and has clashed with a group of economic liberals in the government that included Ulyukayev.",worldnews,"November 8, 2017 ",1

12987,Investors see shades of Quebec in Catalonia vote,"A flight by businesses from Catalonia s independence crisis has drawn comparisons with Quebec, the French-speaking Canadian province that deterred investors with a decades-long independence push. Opinion polls showed support for pro-independence parties at just under 50 percent as campaigning for a Dec. 21 election began on Tuesday, enough to dampen the Madrid government s hopes the vote would end a volatile standoff over secession.  Carrying on as before means chaos,  said Jordi Alberich, managing director of Cercle d Economia, a business association based in the Catalan capital, Barcelona.  What has happened is tremendously serious and it could get even worse.  The election is seen by pro-independence parties as a de-facto referendum on a split from Spain following a banned plebiscite which led to clashes between Spanish police and protesters on Oct 1 and the subsequent dismissal of the Catalan government by Madrid. While it may not propel secessionist forces back into regional government, it could end up sustaining their cause and thereby putting off investors over the longer term. Almost 3,000 firms have shifted their headquarters outside the region, many to Madrid, mirroring the flight of companies from Quebec s Montreal for Toronto before and after its first referendum in 1980 delivered defeat for independence. The Catalan exodus has so far been administrative rather than physical, with companies effectively shifting domiciles, the  brass plate  of the business, to avoid legal and tax complications rather than moving staff or operations. They fear secession would leave them outside the euro zone and exposed to the uncertain policies and possible tax grabs of a new republic burdened by the region s existing large debts. Madrid, eager for unionist parties to score a clear victory on Dec. 21 and put the crisis to rest, says the economic impact will be only short term, but there are signs the uncertainty is already affecting longer-term investment decisions.  If I had been contacted by an American investor asking:  Should I open a small office in Barcelona?  three or four years ago, I would have said:  Yes, of course ,  said the Spain country head for an international investment bank.  Now I can t say that anymore ... The pain inflicted by the independence process scares money away.   He, like other bankers and chief executives, declined to speak publicly because the issue is divisive. Those who speak out for one side or other can become targets of criticism and abuse. The Spanish government has already trimmed its 2018 economic growth forecast to 2.3 percent due to the Catalan crisis, and its Independent Authority of Fiscal Responsibility has warned of a bigger impact next year if it is not resolved. Tourism to the region and its main draw card, Barcelona, has slumped, leading to Spain s first fall in retail sales for more than three years. Spain s economy minister recently noted a  strong deceleration  in Catalonia in the final quarter, and the central bank published an analysis last month based on scenarios that implied impacts ranging from modest to dramatic. In the worst case, it said political uncertainty could cut economic growth by 2.5 percentage points between end-2017 and 2019. In a recent report,  Catalonia, history repeating? , Canadian bank RBC Capital Markets compared it with the fallout from Quebec s 1995 referendum, which delivered the narrowest of defeats for independence and was followed by economic decline. ""Even if the independence parties fall short of a majority, the damage may have already been done,"" it said of Catalonia's December vote. Graphic tmsnrt.rs/2AGBazV The Spanish region s pro-independence camp says it pays more than its fair share of tax income out of the country s 17 regions and during the five-year economic crisis its stronger economy propped up poorer areas such as Andalusia and Murcia. The biggest pro-independence party, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), has dismissed government warnings secession would cause economic damage and launched its campaign focusing on social issues like housing and energy poverty. Quebec s independence movement, triggered by the 1960s push by French-speakers for economic equality, led to a decline in the province s English-speaking population and its economic affluence, with banks and companies moving their head offices from Montreal, then a thriving financial hub. Canada s second-most populous province has made economic strides in recent years, but it continues to lag other provinces in indicators like household income. Between 1970 and 1981, as pro-sovereignty Parti Quebecois gained political momentum, Montreal lost 18,992 head offices in resource, manufacturing and service sectors, according to a 1983 University of Saskatchewan study. Canada s largest life insurance company was among those which left in 1977. Politics was not the only factor. Montreal s older manufacturing economy was already facing competition from Toronto.  The relative decline of Montreal   and the exodus of headquarters   was no doubt exacerbated by politics but was not solely caused by politics,  said Richard Shearmur, a professor at McGill University s school of urban planning in Montreal. The Catalan crisis has drawn interest in Quebec: last week, two members of Catalonia s secessionist Candidatura d Unitat Popular (CUP) party spoke at an event organised by a left-leaning Quebec opposition party. But Quebec polls show support for separation, especially among young adults, is in decline, while in Catalonia polls show pro-independence parties continue to command strong support. The last Catalan government was made up of a coalition of pro-independence parties under the name  Together for Yes , propped up by CUP lawmakers who did not join the government s ranks. Opinion polls show pro-independence and pro-unity parties almost in a dead heat for December s election.",worldnews,"December 5, 2017 ",1
6065,Crowd controversy: The making of an Inauguration Day photo,"The picture that lit up social media and unsettled the White House began with a trek up 50 flights of stairs, nearly to the top of the Washington Monument, for a bird’s eye view of Donald Trump’s inauguration on Friday as the 45th U.S. president.  Reuters had asked the U.S. National Park Service in an email on Jan. 13 whether a photographer could be posted on the observation level near the top of the monument, the highest vantage point overlooking the National Mall. The next business day, the park service agreed to grant Reuters access, on condition the news agency would make the picture available to other media that requested it.  Because the elevator is under renovation, photographer Lucas Jackson had to climb 897 steps to reach the 500-foot (152-meter) elevation, carrying a backpack and shoulder bag full of photo gear, plus a step ladder. “It was definitely a strenuous climb,” Jackson said. A CBS News camera operator and a Park Service photographer were the only others taking images from the observation level. Reuters published side-by-side pictures of two moments in history. One image was Trump’s inauguration on Friday, taken by Jackson just as Trump took the oath of office, Jackson said. The other picture was taken by Reuters photographer Stelios Varias from the same spot during former President Barack Obama’s first inauguration, between 12:07 p.m. and 12:26 p.m., during Obama’s inaugural address. Reuters published a combination of the two pictures at 2:02 p.m. (1902 GMT). The caption read: “A combination of photos taken at the National Mall shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01 p.m. (L) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama on January 20, 2009, in Washington, DC.” The caption did not state which crowd was larger. The side-by-side images soon went viral on social media sites such as Twitter, where people added commentary about the relative size of the crowds. The controversy dominated Trump’s first weekend in office. From Trump’s vantage point, the new president saw a sea of people that he estimated at 1 million to 1.5 million strong, according to his remarks on Saturday at CIA headquarters. Trump chided the “dishonest media” for showing pictures of empty spaces on the mall. Later that day, White House spokesman Sean Spicer accused  some of the media of engaging in “deliberately false reporting.”  “This was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe,” Spicer said. Spicer elaborated on Monday, saying he stood by the remark given the “tens of millions of people that watched it online” with devices that were unavailable in the past.",politicsNews,"January 23, 2017 ",0
7070,"Donald Trump’s Statement After Losing Wisconsin Is Insane, Even For Him","Donald Trump s entire image is based around the idea that he is a  winner,  and while that idea isn t supported by the reality of Trump s legacy of failed businesses and ventures, it is still jarring to see his reaction after he loses a battle.Republican voters in Wisconsin chose Ted Cruz over Trump in the primary on Wednesday night, and as he has in the past, Trump lost ugly.His campaign issued a bizarre, unhinged press release to the media after the results had been called in favor of Cruz:Donald J. Trump withstood the onslaught of the establishment yet again. Lyin  Ted Cruz had the Governor of Wisconsin, many conservative talk radio show hosts, and the entire party apparatus behind him. Not only was he propelled by the anti-Trump Super PAC s spending countless millions of dollars on false advertising against Mr. Trump, but he was coordinating with his own Super PAC s (which is illegal) who totally control him. Ted Cruz is worse than a puppet   he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump. We have total confidence that Mr. Trump will go on to win in New York, where he holds a substantial lead in all the polls, and beyond. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who can secure the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton, or whomever is the Democratic nominee, in order to Make America Great Again.Completely over the top, factually inaccurate, and failing to make sense: All hallmarks of the Trump campaign so far. It shows why Republican establishment bigwigs are arguing over strategies to take him down at the convention, as polls regularly show him losing in double digits to both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. A poll from Mason Dixon even showed Trump with only a single-digit lead over Clinton in blood red Mississippi.But as this release shows, Trump isn t going to let his campaign be snuffed out quietly. If he loses at all, it s going to be with a loud, primal scream, and the GOP s bigwigs are going to hear all about it.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 6, 2016",0

6947,Elementary School Goes On Lockdown After Right-Wing Dad Threatens Teachers Over Sex Ed Class,"If there is one thing conservatives hate more than President Obama, it is the thought of their children receiving a well-rounded education   especially one that involves comprehensive sex education. In fact, an Iowa father was so enraged about the health class being taught that he caused an elementary school and others to go into lockdown.Decorah police say Bruce  Deano  Divers, Jr.  has been arrested and charged with three counts for causing the lockdown when he threatened two teachers on Facebook and sent an email promising to retaliate against the school because of health classes. The Decorah School District released a statement on Sunday night telling parents that schools would be in lockdown on Monday as a precautionary measure.According to KWWL News after they ran the original story, Divers reached out to them and sent them a copy of the email he sent the school. It read: Decorah schools spiritually declared war against my house today. When I retaliate Monday morning Apparently, this right-wing nutjob believes that a holy war has been waged because his child was given health information. Ironically, he could have avoided the entire situation if he d done his job as a parent months ago, according to Superintendent Mike Haluska. Interestingly enough, we have paper work available at the beginning of the school year for anyone who wishes to have their children exempted from any conversations that have to do with that type of subject matter. So what exactly were the kids learning about that pissed him off so much? It had to be about sex, right?WRONG.Superintendent Haluska said that the fourth-grade students were learning about puberty and human body growth. He freaked out because his kid was taught about puberty. Seriously. That s how crazy science-hating conservatives are. Let s forget for a minute that comprehensive sex education is vital to reducing the occurrence of sexually transmitted diseases and reducing the rate of teen pregnancy, learning about their bodies in a health class is absolutely vital to be able to function in society.We ve all seen the movie Carrie, do you remember when she got her period but had no idea what the hell it was because of her crazy religious mother kept her sheltered?That s what right-wing, anti-education parents what to subject their kids to.Featured image via screenshot",News,"April 12, 2016",1

4980,Trump Middle East envoy meets Netanyahu in Jerusalem,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met on Monday, Netanyahu’s office said, as the new administration tries to restart peace talks with the Palestinians. A statement from the Israeli leader’s office said Jason Greenblatt “reaffirmed President Trump’s commitment to Israel’s security and to the effort to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve a lasting peace through direct negotiations.” Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been frozen since 2014 and the Palestinians have been concerned at the more favorable approach shown by Washington toward Netanyahu since Trump came to office in January. The statement added that during a conversation lasting more than five hours, Netanyahu and Greenblatt discussed Israel’s settlement building “with the hope of reaching a formula that will aim to promote peace and security.”  One of the most heated issues between Israel and the Palestinians is Israel’s building of settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, territory the Palestinians want for their own future state along with the Gaza Strip. On Friday, Trump spoke to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and invited him to the White House. It was the first phone call between the two leaders since Trump took office. Greenblatt is set to meet Abbas in the West Bank on Tuesday. The Israeli statement added that “Greenblatt stressed how important enabling the growth of the Palestinian economy and improving the quality of life for Palestinians are to President Trump.” Before taking office, Trump named Greenblatt, his company’s top lawyer, as his special negotiator for trade deals and other talks and his adviser to the Middle East and special representative for international negotiations.

16999,MUSLIM GITMO PRISONERS DICTATE RULES: Women Guards Not Allowed To Transport Terrorists [Video],"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?Female soldiers serving at Guantanamo Bay are not being allowed to transport inmates following a court order issued in response to prisoners who complained on religious grounds, according to Republican senators who recently returned from a visit to the prison camp.Inmates apparently complained the female soldiers  actions were an insult to their Islamic faith, but the senators blasted the court decision as an  insult to women.  Top U.S. military leaders agreed the directive is  outrageous,  while suggesting they re currently bound by the order.Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., first revealed the decision at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday morning. She told Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford that on a visit Friday to the detention center, she was told female soldiers were not being allowed to transport the  9/11 five    five inmates suspected of masterminding the 2001 terror attack   after the court order. We have a situation down there where we met with women guards who are being prevented from fully performing their mission because the five 9/11 attackers who are charged with killing 3,000 Americans will not allow them to perform their duties because they re women,  Ayotte said. It s outrageous,  Dunford agreed.  That s being worked by lawyers, it s an injunction. I m not using that as an excuse, but that s where it is right now. I think it is counter to the way we treat service members, including female service members, and outrageous is a very good word for it,  Defense Secretary Ash Carter added.A military judge issued the order in January prohibiting female guards from transporting the defendants, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to and from legal proceedings after they refused to meet with defense lawyers and complained that any physical contact with unrelated women violated their Muslim beliefs.The ruling by Army Col. James Pohl was meant to deal with their complaints, which posed a threat to legal proceedings.At a press conference following Tuesday s Senate hearing, Sens. Ayotte; Tim Scott, R-S.C.; and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.   who accompanied Ayotte on the visit to the facility   expanded on the issue.Capito said the country is letting the  9/11 five dictate  the procedures in the U.S. military, adding that it is  amazing  a military judge would rule in such a way. Terrorists should not dictate to us what our men and women in uniform are permitted to do,  Ayotte said.  This is not an insult to Islam, it s an insult to women.

3349,WATCH: Fox Panel Pretends Republicans Never Treated The Obama Family Like Sh*t,"Anybody who says conservatives always treated the Obama family with dignity and respect deserve to be smacked HARD to jog their memory.Because ever since Donald Trump was elected, conservatives have been insisting that we should all unite behind him and treat him with nothing but respect because that s how they treated President Obama.Except that s not how they treated President Obama at all. For eight years, conservatives have called him and his family every name in the book, particularly favoring the N-word. They also vowed to sabotage his presidency from the very first day. But they have the gall to call for everyone to give Trump a chance even though they never gave Obama a chance.And the complete disrespect of our current president continued during a discussion on Fox Business, which was about Michelle Obama s interview with Oprah Winfrey expressing the feeling of hopelessness that has engulfing millions of Americans since since the results came in on Election Day.Of course, Fox host Maria Bartiromo and her right-wing guests attacked Mrs. Obama, with Morgan Ortagus literally demanding her to shut up and smile. You could really hear the disdain in her voice,  Ortagus opined.  People need to understand the American people spoke, the Electoral College voted and it s time to move on. And the American people actually decided that it was a repudiation of the past eight years of the type of presidency that Barack Obama [had] and the policies he s ensued [sic]. But the American people voted for Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes so this election was definitely not a repudiation of President Obama. It was a demonstration of Russian power to meddle in our political process. Also, President Obama has a higher approval rating than Trump.But Ortagus continued to whine. You didn t hear Laura Bush saying anything eight years ago. She was gracious, she was classy, she was warm and welcoming to the new first family. And I think that Ms. Obama needs to take a cue from Laura Bush and probably just smile and be helpful to Melania Trump. Kevin Kelly then chimed in by accusing everyone who have lost hope of being lazy moochers who rely on government for everything.Ortagus agreed and then treated Michelle Obama as if she s  the help. What really just irked me about the interview is I thought it was really inappropriate. If I were in her position, I would think she should be helping the incoming first lady, the incoming administration. It s a huge transition for the first family. Melania Trump has a young son, she had young children. Let s focus on the positive and help the new first family transition. It doesn t feel like the other side understands or really cares what the American people just voted for,  Bartiromo said.Here s the video via YouTube.Again, Donald Trump LOST the popular vote, so the American people voted AGAINST him. Furthermore, President Obama won both of his elections by far wider margins but conservatives didn t care abut how the American people voted in 2008 or in 2012. They treated the Obamas like shit, and even attacked their young children and continue to do so today. So they have no right to whine about how people are treating Donald Trump. Turnabout is fair play, and Democrats should treat Trump the same way conservatives treated Obama.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"December 19, 2016",1
15019,Former intelligence officials say Trump is being manipulated by Putin,"Two former top U.S. intelligence officials said on Sunday they fear President Donald Trump is being manipulated by Russian President Vladimir Putin, after Trump said he believed Putin was sincere in denying Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Former CIA Director John Brennan and ex-National Intelligence Director James Clapper both said Trump was mishandling Moscow ties even as a special counsel investigates possible collusion between Trump s campaign team and Russia.      I think Mr. Trump is, for whatever reason, either intimidated by Mr. Putin, afraid of what he could do, or what might come out as a result of these investigations... It s either naivet , ignorance or fear in terms of what Mr. Trump is doing vis- -vis the Russians,  Brennan said in an appearance with Clapper on CNN s  State of the Union.    Clapper added that foreign leaders who roll out the red carpet for Trump are able to manipulate Trump.  I do think both the Chinese and the Russians think they can play him,  Clapper said. Their comments came after Trump told reporters over the  weekend that he had spoken with Putin again over allegations of Russian meddling in the presidential election and that the Russian president again denied any involvement.  I really believe that, when he tells me that, he means it,  Trump told reporters.  I think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country.  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on the same show that the criticism leveled against Trump s management of relations with Russia and China was  ridiculous.   President Trump is not getting played by anybody,  Mnuchin said.     Trump also took a swipe at Obama-era intelligence officials  Brennan, Clapper and former FBI Director James Comey, calling  them  political hacks  and questioning the findings of a U.S. intelligence report that concluded that Russians sought to tilt  the election in Trump s favor. Facing sharp criticism, Trump walked back from some of those comments on Sunday, saying he has faith in the intelligence leaders he has hired. Brennan on Sunday called Trump s criticism of him a  badge of honor,  and Clapper suggested said Trump s denial of Russian interference in the election  poses a peril to the country.  When asked, Brennan declined to say whether he knows of any intelligence to suggest that the Russians have compromising or damaging information on Trump.

12336,Mexico Senate committees pass controversial security bill,"Mexican Senate committees on Wednesday approved a controversial security bill that human rights groups say risks granting excessive power to the armed forces in their already checkered role in combating organized crime in the country. The bill, which enjoys some cross-party support between conservatives and centrists, will now pass to the floor of the upper house of Congress for discussion and possible approval late on Wednesday or on Thursday morning. The Law of Internal Security aims to regulate the armed forces  role in combating drug cartels, a conflict which has claimed well over 100,000 lives in the last decade. Senate committees approved the bill on Wednesday, a senate spokesman said. Lawmakers who support the bill say it will set out clear rules that limit the use of soldiers to fight crime. Rights groups have strongly attacked the bill, saying it prioritizes the military s role in fighting the gangs over improving the police, and could open the door to greater abuses and impunity by the armed forces. The military has already been embroiled in multiple human rights scandals including extrajudicial killings of gang members and the disappearance of 43 students near one of its bases in 2014. The United Nations, Amnesty International and Mexican human rights organizations have all criticized the bill.   This law should not be approved quickly, it puts liberties at risk by giving more power to the armed forces without designing controls and counterweights,  said Santiago Aguirre from the Miguel Agustin Pro Center for Human Rights.

Recently, Conway was caught lying about the American Health Care Act, the disastrous replacement to Obamacare   and even the GOP is pissed about it.According to Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Conway needs to shut up and sit down when it comes to the recently unveiled Republican health care bill. In an interview with CNN host Jim Scuitto, Cassidy trashed Conway for trying to speak for the Republican Party as a whole, and made it clear that she was merely the spokeswoman for Donald Trump, not the GOP. Scuitto asked Cassidy about Conway s recent false statements: Over the weekend, Kellyanne Conway, spokesperson and surrogate for the White House, made a remarkable claim that there aren t any Medicaid cuts in this bill. Is the GOP misleading Americans about what s actually in this bill? Cassidy s response could not have been any more fed up with Conway. Cassidy bluntly said: Kellyanne Conway is not the GOP. However, Scuitto argued that  She s a very close spokesperson for the president and speaks for the president. Cassidy just shook his head and said,  I just can t address that , signaling that yet another Republican is ashamed beyond belief over Trump and his incompetent, dishonest team.You can watch the interview below:Conway had blatantly lied about there being no Medicaid cuts in the GOP s new health care plan   there are actually substantial cuts being made to the program and they are being widely reported, particularly after the CBO has weighed in.Conway s lies yet again prove that she cannot be trusted, even after having previously banned from all reputable cable news shows. She obviously hasn t learned her lesson.Featured image via Yana Paskova / Getty Images",News,"June 26, 2017",0
9127,Senate passes $602 billion defense authorization bill,"The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to pass a $602 billion defense authorization bill, despite President Barack Obama’s threat to veto the annual policy measure over issues including a ban on closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison. The vote was 85-13, far more than the majority needed to pass the 100-member Senate. Six Republicans and seven members of the Democratic caucus voted against the bill, which authorizes military spending for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. Obama gave a long list of objections to the versions of the bill passed by the Senate and House of Representatives, including provisions making it more difficult to close the detention center at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba and the use of funds specially designated for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to allow the military to avoid mandatory spending limits. The Senate’s version of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, now must be reconciled with the one passed by the House last month before it can be sent to Obama. The House bill also faces a veto threat. If the bill is finished before November, when every member of the House and one-third of the Senate is up for re-election, a veto could prove challenging for Democrats. Obama’s party is trying to keep the White House, and hopes to regain the Senate majority it lost in 2014, if not control of the House. But Democrats perpetually battle accusations from Republicans that they are soft on defense, a fight that could be more difficult if they block the major Pentagon policy bill. Republican Senator John McCain, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said he was disappointed the bill did not include a program that would help Afghans who are in danger because they worked for American troops to move to the United States. “They are the number one target for the Taliban and for ISIS (Islamic State),” McCain said in the Senate after the bill passed without an amendment extending the program to provide Special Immigrant Visas for interpreters and others who worked for U.S. forces. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who had introduced the amendment, called its omission “unconscionable.” In a statement, she said, “For many of them, this could be a death sentence.” The bill would also require young women to register for the military draft, as the Department of Defense opens all of the military, including combat roles, to females. A few conservative senators voted against the measure because of that provision. The bill passed with a compromise on the use of Russian RD-180 rocket engines. Lawmakers eased a ban on their use late last year, worried that it could drive United Launch alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, out of business and leave only privately held SpaceX to transport satellites into space. An amendment from Republican Senator Cory Gardner and Democrat Bill Nelson gives the Pentagon time to develop and test a replacement for the Russian-made engines and limits their use for launches. McCain, a harsh critic of Moscow, had tried to stop the use of the RD-180 to send a message to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.  The bill also bars military base closures, despite military leaders saying they have more capacity than they need. Closing bases is a thorny issue for many lawmakers, especially in an election year.",politicsNews,"June 14, 2016 ",0

18476,"Brazil's largest ever corruption probe nearing its end, judge says","Brazilian federal Judge S rgio Moro on Monday said the Car Wash probe, Brazil s largest ever corruption investigation, is nearing completion in the southern city of Curitiba, where it started in 2014.   There are still investigations under way, but a large part of the work has been done,  Moro told reporters in Sao Paulo after a ceremony where he received a distinction from U.S.-based Notre Dame University for his work leading the probe. Brazil s largest corruption probe started almost by accident in Curitiba, when investigators went to a local Car Wash to ask owners why the small company had done several international money transfers. From there it spread to several state-controlled companies, politicians, parties and private engineering groups. But Curitiba remained the host city for almost the whole investigation.     Moro said he is a bit tired due to the workload resulting from the spreading probe, but he ruled out leaving the operation until it is concluded. He also dismissed suggestions that he could run in next year s election, despite the huge popularity he gained among Brazilians. Some pollsters such as Datafolha have included Moro s name in some early surveys.  They are losing their time, because this is not going to happen. Simple as that , he said, adding that he is a professional federal judge and will remain so. Despite the prospect of work related to the Car Wash investigation to end in Curitiba, Moro said they it will go on in other cities who host higher court instances and also in Brasilia, where several parts of the probe are being conducted by the Supreme Court.",worldnews,"October 2, 2017 ",1
2385,Muhammad Ali’s Son Detained At Airport Because His Name Sounds Too Muslim,"Immigration officials in Florida proved how out of control things are in Trump s America by detaining the son of Muhammad Ali because his name happens to sound too Muslim for their liking.Muhammad Ali Jr. and his mother, Khalilah Camacho-Ali, were on their way home after speaking at a Black History Month event in Montego Bay, Jamaica. On Feb. 7, they flew into Fort Lauderdale, Florida. And then things took a disturbing turn.Chris Mancini, a lawyer and friend of the family says they were pulled to the side as they were going through customs. Khalilah Camacho-Ali was released when she pulled out a photo of her with the legendary boxer, but Muhammad Ali Jr. didn t have such a photo. Apparently, being related to a famous person would have meant more to officials than the fact that he s an American citizen with a U.S. passport to prove it.Ali Jr. was held by immigration officials and questioned for almost two hours. Where did you get your name from?  they asked him over and over. When they asked him if he was a Muslim, he said yes, and that really set off alarm bells for officials. They continued to question him about his religion and repeatedly asked him where he was born. Just for the record, he was born in Philadelphia in 1971.USA Today reports:While Ali Jr. was detained, Camacho-Ali ran around the airport asking,  Where s my son?  and begging for help, according to Mancini. Because incidents involving customs officials are considered to be on federal soil, local police had no jurisdiction to help her. Ali Jr. was eventually released two hours later, and the family contacted Mancini the following day.They have both traveled all over the world and never, ever, have they been subjected to this kind of treatment, said Mancini.  To the Ali family, it s crystal clear that this is directly linked to Mr. Trump s efforts to ban Muslims from the United States,  he added. Imagine walking into an airport and being asked about your religion,  he said.  This is classic customs profiling. According to Mancini, the Ali family is debating whether or not to file a federal lawsuit and are searching for others who have been subjected to this kind of racial profiling and harassment.Featured image via Andrew H.

8425,Naked Trump statues draw dozens of onlookers in U.S. cities,"An artists’ collective took credit for exposing Donald Trump to unflattering scrutiny on Thursday, saying it was responsible for a life-sized nude statue of the Republican presidential candidate that turned up in a New York City park.       Copies of the orange-tinted likeness - featuring a massive belly, small fingers and missing some genital parts - were simultaneously unveiled in downtown Manhattan’s Union Square Park and public places in four other U.S. cities. The collective titled the work “The Emperor Has No Balls.” In New York, the unauthorized installation appeared to surprise passers-by - prompting stares, giggles and shrugs of bemusement from park visitors. Ina Cope, a 58-year-old retiree from the Bronx borough of New York, said she was not expecting to see the Trump statue when she got off the subway to meet a friend for lunch. “It was crazy: I was coming off the train, minding my own business, and there it was,” she said, laughing.  By early afternoon, workers from New York’s Department of Parks and Recreation had taken down the statue.  Mae Ferguson, a Parks Department spokeswoman, said the statue was removed because the installation of any unapproved structure is illegal in any city park. The activist collective, a group called INDECLINE that includes artists, musicians and filmmakers, claimed ownership of the work, saying in an email that the statues were also placed in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and Cleveland. It said an artist called Ginger helped create the likeness. “These fleeting installations represent this fleeting nightmare and in the fall, it is our wish to look back and laugh at Donald Trump’s failed and delusional quest to obtain the presidency,” INDECLINE said in a statement. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond immediately to an email with a request for comment.",politicsNews,"August 18, 2016 ",1
21230,Japan seeks funds to boost missile ranges days after North Korea threat,"Japan s defense ministry on Thursday sought $160 million in a record budget request to develop swift, longer-range missiles to extend its military punch in East Asia, countering growing Chinese strength and an increasing North Korean threat. If approved, the proposal for a rise of 2.5 percent in defense spending to 5.26 trillion yen ($48 billion) for the year starting April 1 would be the sixth straight annual increase as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe bolsters the military. The funds will pay for ballistic missile defense upgrades, six F-35 stealth fighters, four V-22 Osprey tilt rotor troop carriers, besides orders for new naval vessels, including a submarine and two compact warships. Around $90 million of the requested missile development funds of $160 million will go on studying hypersonic missiles to quickly penetrate enemy defenses. The rest will pay for research on extending missile range,  technology that could potentially be used to help develop strike weapons. South Korea s air force conducted an exercise with two U.S. nuclear-capable bombers above the Korean peninsula on Thursday, two days after a North Korean missile fired over Japan sharply raised tension.  The research and development is for island defense,  a Ministry of Defence official told a briefing, referring to the southwestern Okinawa island chain skirting the East China Sea, where Japan is embroiled in a territorial dispute with China. The funding for missile development, though relatively small, could nonetheless spark controversy, since Japan s war-renouncing constitution imposes restrictions on strike weapons for the military. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Japan had consistently hyped the so-called  China threat  to increase its defense spending, and urged it to learn the lessons of history and pay heed to its neighbors  security concerns.    Regardless of what its reasons are, Japan s defense spending is increasing every year and has reached a new historical high. We express concern about this,  Hua told a regular press briefing. Some lawmakers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) argue that Japan needs weapons able to strike North Korean missile sites, so as to deter attacks by Pyongyang. The longest range missiles in Japan s arsenal, which includes anti-aircraft and anti-ship munitions, have ranges of less than 300 kilometers. A group of LDP lawmakers that recommended Japan acquire strike weapons was led by Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera before he took up his post in August. But such a proposed shift in military strategy would face stiff political opposition from critics in Japan who say Abe s hawkish policies have gone too far, hurting his already soggy popularity.  Striking enemy bases after an attack to stop subsequent launches would seem like a natural thing to do, but that would be difficult for people in Japan to accept under the current constitution,  an LDP lawmaker said, asking not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media. The proposed defense budget will face scrutiny by Ministry of Finance officials who may seek to rein in military outlays as they juggle demands for higher spending on health and welfare for Japan s aging population.",worldnews,"August 31, 2017 ",1
12847,Australia celebrates 'day for love' as it allows same-sex marriage,"Australia became the 26th nation to legalise same-sex marriage on Thursday, prompting cheers and singing from a packed parliament public gallery in a country where some states ruled homosexual acts to be illegal until just 20 years ago. Lawmakers, who had cast aside a conservative push to allow religious objectors to refuse service to same-sex couples, waved rainbow flags and embraced on the floor of the chamber, after the overwhelming vote in favour of the bill. Fewer than five of 150 MPs voted against it.  What a day. What a day for love, for equality, for respect,  said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.  It is time for more marriages.  The law, which will also recognise same-sex marriages solemnised in foreign countries, takes effect from Saturday. Because a month s notice is required for the state to recognise a marriage, the first legal same-sex unions will be in January. Five-time Olympic gold-medal winner, the swimmer Ian Thorpe, who came out in 2014, said the law reflected contemporary Australia and would support people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual queer or intersex (LGBTQI).   It will give each of us the sense of what modern Australia is, and is, in fact, the way that most of us see this country as being, and will allow LGBTQI people in our nation to know that fairness is one of our values,  he told reporters in Canberra. Australians had overwhelmingly endorsed legalising same-sex marriage in a postal survey.  What a moment for the country,  said Christine Forster, a Sydney councillor and the sister of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, standing among throngs of rainbow-clad campaigners for a  Yes  vote, outside parliament with her female partner. She said she planned to go to her brother s house to celebrate. Abbott, who is still a member of parliament, was one of the most prominent  no  campaigners. He left the chamber before the vote. The bill cleared the upper house last month. During the debate in the lower house on Monday, a politician proposed to his same-sex partner. Both Turnbull s Liberal-National coalition government and the main opposition Labor Party had said they wanted to pass it by Dec. 7. But despite the support of the main parties, religious organisations and conservative lawmakers had voiced strong opposition and proposed dozens of amendments. During the debate, they pressed for broad protections for religious objectors, among them florists and bankers, to refuse service to same-sex couples. But their efforts were rejected.  These amendments, rather, are a shield for people and organisations that hold to a traditional view of marriage. They are not a sword to be wielded in the service of bigotry,  government MP Andrew Hastie said in parliament. Amendments to permit lay celebrants to decline to solemnise same-sex marriages and businesses opposed to the unions to refuse service at wedding receptions were all defeated, one after the other, during three days of debate.  Love has won, and it s time to pop the bubbly,  Greens MP and same-sex marriage supporter Adam Bandt said.",worldnews,"December 7, 2017 ",0
4345,"In big win for Trump, Senate approves his conservative court pick","The Republican-led Senate on Friday gave Donald Trump the biggest triumph of his young presidency, confirming his Supreme Court nominee over stout Democratic opposition and restoring a conservative majority on the highest U.S. judicial body. The Senate, which last year refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama’s nominee to the court, voted 54-45 to approve Republican Trump’s pick, Colorado-based federal appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch, to the lifetime job. Three Democrats joined the Republicans in voting for Gorsuch. Gorsuch’s confirmation ends the longest Supreme Court vacancy since 1862 during the American Civil War, with the court down a justice for almost 14 months since long-serving conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died on Feb. 13, 2016. “Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation process was one of the most transparent and accessible in history, and his judicial temperament, exceptional intellect, unparalleled integrity and record of independence makes him the perfect choice to serve on the nation’s highest court,” Trump said in a statement. “He’s going to make an incredible addition to the court,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor. Illustrating the importance of the moment, Vice President Mike Pence served as the Senate’s presiding officer during the vote to confirm Gorsuch, who also worked in Republican former President George W. Bush’s Justice Department and is the son of the first woman to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Republicans, possessing a 52-48 Senate majority, on Thursday overcame a ferocious Democratic effort to block a confirmation vote, resorting to a rule change known as the “nuclear option.” “Today, for the first time in history, the theft of a Supreme Court seat has been completed, profoundly damaging the integrity of the court,” said Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, referring to Republicans casting aside Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland, who would have tilted the court to the left for the first time in decades. Merkley this week delivered a 15-1/2-hour Senate speech against Gorsuch. The Senate’s approval of Gorsuch reinstates the nine-seat court’s 5-4 conservative majority, fulfilling an important Trump campaign promise. Gorsuch, 49, was the youngest Supreme Court nominee since Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1991 picked Clarence Thomas, who was 43 at the time. Gorsuch could be expected to serve for decades, while Trump could make further appointments to the high court to make it even more solidly conservative because three of the eight justices are 78 or older. Three Democratic senators up for re-election in 2018 in states won by Trump last year - Indiana’s Joe Donnelly, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp - voted for Gorsuch. Republican Senator Johnny Isakson missed the vote while recovering from back surgery. Gorsuch’s confirmation gave a boost to Trump, showing he can get important agenda items through a Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans after the House of Representatives last month failed to pass healthcare overhaul legislation. Trump is planning major tax cut legislation as well. Senate Republicans resorted to extraordinary steps to overcome Democratic opposition to Gorsuch, including changing long-standing Senate rules to prohibit the use of a procedural blockade called a filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. The rule change was dubbed the “nuclear option” because it was considered an extreme break from Senate tradition. Democrats accused Gorsuch of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions, and displaying insufficient independence from Trump. Gorsuch joins fellow conservatives Thomas, John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy on a court that also includes liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Trump has recorded accomplishments since taking office on Jan. 20, including a variety of unilateral executive actions such as moving to undo Obama’s climate change regulations. But he has encountered trouble with other major initiatives. Courts blocked his executive action to stop people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. His administration also has faced questions about any role the president’s associates may have played in alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help Trump. The rule change could make it easier for Trump to win confirmation of Supreme Court nominees as long as Republicans control the Senate, with Democrats left powerless to resist even if he gets a chance to replace the court’s senior liberal, 84-year-old Ginsburg, or the court’s swing vote, 80-year-old Kennedy, with more conservative replacements. A conservative-majority court is more likely to support gun rights, abortion regulations, an expansive view of religious liberty and Republican-backed voting restrictions, while opposing curbs on political spending. The court also is likely to tackle transgender rights and union funding in coming years. Among the groups congratulating Gorsuch on his confirmation were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobbying group, the National Rifle Association gun rights group and anti-abortion activists. Gorsuch will be sworn in on Monday in two different ceremonies, one at the court and one at the White House. He can then prepare for the court’s next round of oral arguments, starting on April 17. The court’s current term ends in June. Gorsuch will participate in the justices’ private April 13 conference to consider taking new cases. There are appeals pending on expanding gun rights to include carrying concealed firearms in public, state voting restrictions that critics say are aimed at reducing minority turnout, and allowing business owners to object on religious grounds to providing gay couples certain services.  On April 19, the court will hear a case in which a church contends Missouri violated the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of religious freedom by denying it funds for a playground project due to a state ban on aid to religious organizations. Gorsuch has ruled in favor of expansive religious rights during his decade as a judge.",politicsNews,"April 7, 2017 ",0
4722,Exclusive: Trump to approve Keystone XL at meeting with TransCanada CEO - official,"U.S. President Donald Trump will announce the approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline at the White House on Friday, alongside the chief executive officer of builder TransCanada Corp, according to a senior administration official. The pipeline linking Canadian oil sands to U.S. refiners had been blocked by former President Barack Obama, who said the pipeline would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists and would contribute emissions linked to global warming. Trump signed an executive order to advance the project soon after taking office in January, saying it would create thousands of jobs. The administration official said that among those scheduled to be at the White House for the 10:15 a.m. EDT announcement are TransCanada Chief Executive Russell Girling and Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions. Expedited approval of projects is part of Trump’s approach for a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure package he promised on the campaign trail. The White House is looking for ways to speed up approvals and permits for infrastructure projects, which can sometimes take years to go through the maze of regulatory requirements. “It does fit into the overall strategy the president has for infrastructure,” the official said. The multibillion-dollar Keystone pipeline would bring more than 800,000 barrels per day of heavy crude from Canada’s oil sands in Alberta into Nebraska, linking to an existing pipeline network feeding U.S. refineries and ports along the Gulf of Mexico.  Approvals are still needed from state regulators, and the pipeline could face legal challenges. Conservatives have said they support quick approval. Nick Loris, an energy and environment researcher at the Heritage Foundation, said on Thursday that approval would “re-establish some certainty and sanity to a permitting process that was hijacked by political pandering.” Environmental groups that have opposed the pipeline have said they will continue the fight with petitions, political pressure and mass protests.",politicsNews,"March 24, 2017 ",0

Loomer goes on to point out how liberals like Kathy Griffin and the CNN network who glorify those who commit or threaten violence are responsible for this violent atmosphere, and that they re no better than ISIS. Loomer points out the comparisons between the actors on the Central Park stage who are  gang stabbing  President Trump:  I just couldn t help but think to myself:  Wow! When you re holding a knife to someone s throat in the play, and joking about chopping someone s throats off, what makes you any better than ISIS?  Jack Posobiac makes a very interesting point at about the gang stabbing of President Trump:  It was like a gang stabbing. All the people stabbing him were minorities.

Yes, it was an intentional act. Yes, it was an act of terror. The problem is when you say the word  terror  because of word association it automatically assumes you are talking about people of the Muslim faith. And that is why he said an intentional act and not terrorism because we don t know if it was Muslim. None of these organizations have taken credit for it. So before we go out and start to blame and shame a whole religion we ought to be very careful and get all the facts first.

Maybe muslims wouldn t need to be offended by the word  terror  of they simply stopped committing acts of terror! As an American, anyone that is a citizen has the freedom of speech, so to dictate that any word we use that is in fact the correct word to describe attacks such as the Manhattan bombing, the New Jersey Bombing, and even the Minnesota Mall attack, is well within our rights as said American citizens.If anyone, muslim or otherwise, doesn t like that word they are free to not use it, but no one is free to strip the right to use it from everyone else.H/T [ Gateway Pundit ]",left-news,"Sep 18, 2016",0
13545,Three dead bodies pulled from sea near Spain after migrant boat sinks,"Spanish rescue services pulled three drowned men from the Strait of Gibraltar after rescuing one man from a half-sunken, rickety boat and another from the open sea, an emergency services spokeswoman said on Wednesday. The men are believed to be from a boat that was carrying migrants attempting to cross into Europe, the spokeswoman said. One of the rescued men said there were six people aboard originally, she said. The search continues for the sixth person. Conditions in the Strait of Gibraltar - a narrow strip of water that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea - are currently dangerous with bad weather and big waves, she said.  Tens of thousands of migrants attempt the treacherous crossing of the Mediterranean Sea from Africa every year in unseaworthy boats, leading to thousands of deaths by drowning. Migrant drownings have topped 3,000 on Mediterranean Sea routes for the fourth straight year, the International Organization for Migration said on Tuesday. Migrants seeking a better life in Europe have sought new routes through Spain in an effort to get around European Union actions to curb migration in the central and eastern Mediterranean.

11717,Senior Saudi prince says Trump's Jerusalem move threatens stability,"U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital will stoke violence in the region, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said, dismissing reports of prior consultations made with Riyadh over the move.   It is a very bad decision. The consequences will be more bloodshed, more conflict rather than peaceful resolution,  Prince Turki, a senior royal family member and a former ambassador to Washington, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday in Riyadh. Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy and veered from international consensus this month by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Most countries say the city s status must be left to negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Saudi Arabia condemned the decision. Saudi King Salman told President Trump that any decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem before a permanent peace settlement is reached will inflame the feelings of Muslims, official media reported. But Saudi Arabia stopped short of calling for any Arab action against the decision. Palestinian officials say Riyadh has been working for weeks behind the scenes to press them to support a nascent U.S. peace plan.  The reaction here was total surprise,  said Prince Turki, who now holds no government office but remains influential.   ... If there has been prior consultation or anything like that, why would the King go through the process of telling him (Trump) this is a bad idea and make that known publicly?    I don t think there ever was any discussion of this  before the decision was taken, he added. As regards possible Saudi and Arab action in response to Trump s decision, Prince Turki said:  I am sure lots of people would prefer to have something just for the sake of appearance but I don t think that s how the Saudi government operates. If it is going to take action, it is going to be a serious action.  Four Palestinian officials, who spoke on condition they not be named, said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have discussed in detail a grand bargain that Trump and Jared Kushner, the president s son-in-law and adviser, are expected to unveil in the first half of 2018. Arab officials say the plan is still in its early phases of development.  Prince Turki said he was unaware of details of any such  plan. Prince Turki is a son of King Faisal, who was assassinated in 1975. His brother, Saud al-Faisal, served as foreign minister for 40 years until 2015, and their branch of the family is seen as influential over Saudi foreign policy, even as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has solidified his authority. Prince Saud championed a 2002 Arab peace initiative which called for normalizing relations between Arab countries and Israel in return for Israel s withdrawal from lands occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. In a letter to Trump published in a Saudi newspaper on Dec. 11, Prince Turki said that Trump s  opportunistic  Jerusalem move would threaten security in the region.  The now much diminished terrorist international gets a rejuvenation boost from you and re-energizes its recruitment of volunteers to broaden their murderous attacks on innocent civilians, worldwide,  he wrote in his letter. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said he would encourage a more moderate and tolerant version of Islam in the ultra-conservative kingdom. The ambitious young prince has already taken some steps to loosen Saudi Arabia s ultra-strict social restrictions, scaling back the role of religious morality police, permitting public concerts and announcing plans to allow women to drive next year. Prince Turki said that Saudis share in the blame for the spread of extremist ideology through funding of mosques abroad that may have fallen into the wrong hands, but that such funding stopped since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.    The kingdom has been the victim of such people and such activity... Since Sept. 11 the kingdom has had a sustained and continuous program opposing extremist ideology, not just in the kingdom but abroad,  he told Reuters.     For a period of time, yes it is true there were some Saudis who promoted issues of extremism and so on. Now we are getting rid of all of those. I would say we have gotten rid of most of them, if not all of them.",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",0
1368,Monica Lewinsky Wrote An Obituary For Roger Ailes And It Was BRUTAL,"Last week, disgraced former Fox News chief, Roger Ailes, died. I know you re supposed to speak reverentially about the dead, but Ailes was toxic. He was a misogynist, a racist and he turned low information voters into a key demographic. Without Roger Ailes, we would likely not have had two illegal wars and we wouldn t have BLOTUS Trump.For some, though, their toxic relationship with Ailes was far more personal. One notable example of a life he ruined was Monica Lewinsky, who, to this day, is best known as the woman who gave Bill Clinton a blow job. Lewinsky penned her own obituary for Ailes, and there was no reverence. There was resentment and a whole lot of truth. This is not another obituary for Roger Ailes,  Lewinsky wrote,  who died last week 10 months after being ousted at Fox News. It is, I hope, instead an obituary for the culture he purveyed   a culture that affected me profoundly and personally. Hard to deny that. Thanks to Fox News, a consensual affair suddenly became the scandal of the decade   it was the story that was supposed to undo a presidency. Without Lewinsky, Fox News might not be Fox News today.Some experts have noted that viewers found Fox for the first time because of the crisis. John Moody, a Fox executive editor, reflected on that period:  The Lewinsky saga put us on the news map.  As he put it in another interview:  Monica was a news channel s dream come true. But amid that, Fox created the culture of mean. They somehow managed to portray Bill Clinton as a predator (ironic given the culture at Fox News) while portraying Lewinsky as unworthy of a powerful man s attentions.Their dream was my nightmare. My character, my looks and my life were picked apart mercilessly. Truth and fiction mixed at random in the service of higher ratings. My family and I huddled at home, worried about my going to jail   I was the original target of Ken Starr s investigation, threatened with 27 years for having been accused of signing a false affidavit, obstructing justice, suborning perjury and other crimes   or worse, me taking my own life. Meantime, Mr. Ailes huddled with his employees at Fox News, dictating a lineup of talking heads to best exploit this personal and national tragedy.Lewinsky lamented the fact that it wasn t only Fox, and that Fox changed the media landscape. Even MSNBC was committed to almost non-stop coverage of the scandal that shouldn t have been. The internet, though, made it much, much worse.Just as television news was devolving into a modern coliseum, the internet came along and compounded this culture of shame and vitriol. Remember: The story of my affair was not broken by The Washington Post, The New York Times or the networks, but online by the Drudge Report. The comments on television and online were excruciating. I ceased being a three-dimensional person. Instead I became a whore, a bimbo, a slut and worse. Just days after the story broke, Fox asked its viewers to vote on this pressing question: Is Monica Lewinsky an  average girl  or a  young tramp looking for thrills ?Lewinsky isn t cheering for Fox News to be cancelled. In fact, she praised them for firing Ailes and Bill O Reilly, both of whom were accused of being serial sexual harassers. She also said she believes that credible conservative voices should be heard, that it s an important part of a healthy democracy. However, Ailes helped create the current cruel and toxic political environment, and for that, he won t be missed.Featured image of Monica Lewinsky via Bryan Bedder/Getty Images | Featured image of Roger Ailes via Handout/Getty Images.",News,"May 22, 2017",1
5946,Elizabeth Warren Just Proved Why She’s Trump’s Absolute WORST Nightmare (VIDEO),"If there s anyone who has clearly had enough of Donald Trump s ridiculous bullying shenanigans, it s Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Time after time she has just absolutely pummeled his rhetoric and isn t intimidated at all by his name-calling and hyperbolic antics. If she s not battling him on Facebook, she s battling him on Twitter. If she s not facing off with him on social media, she nailing him in a speech. She wants to make damn sure that pompous man gets nowhere near the Oval Office.Going after him yet again, right before her endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president, Warren spoke at the American Constitution Society s national convention. She hit him over the head with the fact that he s a racist bully who is trying to intimidate a judge out of doing his job just because he s of Mexican heritage, albeit born in Indiana. Trump doesn t want him hearing his Trump University case for the very racist reason that Judge Curiel is Latino.One of Warren s best lines from her speech came when she said: Judge Curiel is one of countless American patriots who has spent decades quietly serving his country, sometimes at great risk to his own life. Donald Trump is a loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud who has never risked anything for anyone and serves nobody but himself. BOOM! Wow. So, so true.Trump cannot be president. He doesn t have any of the necessary experience required to be leader of the free world. He wants to be president not for the nation, but for himself, to say that he won. He s a blowhard who deserves to be condemned, and you can bet your ass Elizabeth Warren will keeping hitting him, and hitting him hard.And what scares a fragile, insecure man the most?

14754,Syrian Kurdish leaders back longer U.S role in Syria,"Syrian Kurdish leaders voiced support on Wednesday for a longer-term role for U.S. forces in Syria once Islamic State is defeated, after the United States signalled it would not pull out before there was progress towards a political solution. Comments by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Monday have drawn heavy criticism from the Iran-backed Syrian government, which says Washington is making up a new excuse for keeping its  illegal occupation  forces in Syria. Limiting Iranian influence in Syria and Iraq is a key U.S. aim. Syrian Kurdish groups have emerged as the main partner on the ground for the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in northern and eastern Syria, areas which the Syrian state and Iran have vowed to take back. Kurdish fighters, with Arab allies, U.S. advisers and coalition jets, have driven Islamic State from swathes of territory including their former headquarters in Raqqa city. The Kurdish YPG militia and its political allies have carved out autonomous cantons in the north, and now control nearly a quarter of Syria. Their influence angers neighbour Turkey, which considers the YPG an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers  Party that has fought a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil. The main Syrian Kurdish political party, the PYD, welcomed a longer-term U.S. role in Syria. The U.S. presence should continue until there was a political solution to the Syrian crisis which erupted in 2011, it said.     In a written message to Reuters, the PYD s co-chief, Shahoz Hasan, agreed this would be beneficial.  Without achieving a political solution to the Syrian crisis, and with the continuation of the Turkish and Iranian intervention in Syria, and with the continued presence of al Qaeda groups in Syria, the continued operation of the coalition is better,  Hasan said. Senior Syrian Kurdish politician Fawza Youssef said a U.S. role would be very important for the future.  The United States and the coalition forces played a major role in fighting Daesh, and to reach a fair political settlement, we see a need for international guarantees,  said Youssef, a senior member of the Kurdish-led authority running the cantons in northern Syria. She pointed to an increase in humanitarian aid to northern Syria by Washington and the coalition since the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) captured Raqqa - a sign of a widening U.S. role. Turkey said on Monday the United States had 13 bases in Syria and Russia had five. As all sides in Syria battled Islamic State, the U.S.-backed forces have mostly avoided direct confrontation with the Syrian government, backed by Iran and Russia. But Iranian and Syrian officials are now signalling their intention to take back areas captured from IS by the SDF. Syria s main Kurdish groups say they want a federal system for the whole country, and hope for negotiations with Damascus to shore up their autonomous rule. Their territorial grip has expanded since joining forces with the United States to fight IS, though Washington opposes their autonomy plans. Mattis described this week a role for American troops long after Islamic State militants lose control of all the territory they hold.  Mattis said the U.S. military s longer-term objective would be to prevent the return of an  ISIS 2.0 . But he also suggested that U.S. forces aimed to help set the conditions for a diplomatic solution in Syria.  We re not just going to walk away right now before the Geneva process has traction , he said, a reference to U.N.-backed peace talks. The U.S.-led coalition has repeatedly said it does not seek to fight Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s military.  In response to the Mattis comments, the Syrian government said on Tuesday that Washington was presenting a new excuse to keep its forces in Syria by linking this presence to a political settlement, having previously said its goal was to fight IS. Foreign ministry comments affirmed the government s position that the presence of U.S. and other forces in Syria without government approval was an act of aggression.",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",0
22822,Google is the Engine of Censorship,"21st Century Wire says Late last year, search engine giant Google announced its plans to protect users from the horrors of  fake news  by changing the way it presents search results. According to corporate officials, they hope to shelter  readers by limiting access to what the company deems as  low-quality  information   while promoting what it calls  established  mainstream sources. Critics believe that the company, which now has a virtual monopoly on internet traffic, is now playing god over the info-sphere. While its known that Eric Schmidt, the head of Google s parent company, Alphabet Inc, is regular attendee at the annual secretive Bilderberg meeting which charters the globalist agenda, not much is known about new Google CEO Sundar Pichai and what his personal ideology is, or whether he personally believes that Google s role is to control what the public think about any given issue by fixing the search results on the world s number one search engine. Judging by the culture of conformity at Google, it s not likely that Pichai would be allowed to express any dissenting views if he had them.As 21WIRE pointed out last week regarding the controversy over the recent Google Memo and the firm dismissing employees who are seen to divert from the company s prescribed group think, this same repressive political culture at Google is reflected in its broad new automated censorship program administered by algorithms on its Google search engine   a bold move which effectively disappears political views and articles it does not like, and wishes to bury.Watch this segment from RT America, with guest Andre Damon, editor of the World Socialist Web Site, to explain why he believes his site and other alternative sources are being unfairly targeted in Google s new reordering of visible information through its portal.

7734,Half of Republicans would reject election result if Clinton wins: Reuters/Ipsos,"Donald Trump has repeatedly called this year’s presidential election rigged and has coyly said “I will keep you in suspense” on whether he would accept a Hillary Clinton victory, but many Republicans are less circumspect, according to a new poll. Only half of Republicans would accept Clinton, the Democratic nominee, as their president. And if she wins, nearly 70 percent said it would be because of illegal voting or vote rigging, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. Conversely, seven out of 10 Democrats said they would accept a Trump victory and less than 50 percent would attribute it to illegal voting or vote rigging, the poll showed. The findings come after repeated statements by Trump that the media and the political establishment have rigged the election against him. He also has made a number of statements encouraging his supporters to fan out on Election Day to stop ineligible voters from casting ballots. The U.S. government has accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations and state election systems. Clinton has said she will accept the results of the election no matter the outcome. The poll showed there is broad concern across the political spectrum about voting issues such as ineligible voters casting ballots, voter suppression, and the actual vote count, but Republicans feel that concern more acutely. For example, nearly eight out of 10 Republicans are concerned about the accuracy of the final vote count. And though generally they believe they will be able to cast their ballot, only six out of 10 are confident their vote will be counted accurately. Among Democrats, about six out of 10 are concerned about the vote count. They, too, believe they wi1l be able to cast their ballot, but eight out of 10 are confident their vote will be counted accurately. “Republicans are just more worried about everything than Democrats,” said Lonna Atkeson, a professor at the University of New Mexico and head of the Center for the Study of Voting, Elections, and Democracy. Additionally, seven out of 10 Republicans are concerned about issues such as vote buying, faulty voting machines, or confusing ballot designs. Six out of 10 Democrats feel the same way. Nearly eight out of 10 Republicans are concerned that ineligible voters, including non-citizens, will illegally cast ballots. Four out of 10 Democrats feel the same way. Six out of 10 respondents, regardless of party, say they are concerned about issues such as voter intimidation and suppression.  Atkeson said the level of concern and mistrust in the system, especially among Republicans, is unprecedented. “I’ve never seen an election like this. Not in my lifetime. Certainly not in modern history.” The difference, she said, is Trump. “It has to be the candidate effect.”  She worries that the lack of trust is dangerous. It is one thing to not trust government, but quite another to doubt the election process. “Then the entire premise of democracy comes into question,” she said. About one in five Democrats said they would protest if their candidate loses. Slightly fewer Republicans said they would do the same. Fewer than one in 10 Democrats said they are prepared to take up arms in opposition compared to fewer than one in 20 Republicans. Democrats are also are three times as likely to say they would leave the country. There is one area where there is little disagreement: Most people do not expect the losing candidate to concede the race gracefully.  The poll surveyed 1,192 American adults online from Oct. 17 to 21. The results have a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. The credibility interval for Democrats is 5.1 percentage points; for Republicans it is 5.5 points. (In 4th paragraph corrects to say “ineligible,” not “illegible”)",politicsNews,"October 21, 2016 ",1

4722,Exclusive: Trump to approve Keystone XL at meeting with TransCanada CEO - official,"U.S. President Donald Trump will announce the approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline at the White House on Friday, alongside the chief executive officer of builder TransCanada Corp, according to a senior administration official. The pipeline linking Canadian oil sands to U.S. refiners had been blocked by former President Barack Obama, who said the pipeline would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists and would contribute emissions linked to global warming. Trump signed an executive order to advance the project soon after taking office in January, saying it would create thousands of jobs. The administration official said that among those scheduled to be at the White House for the 10:15 a.m. EDT announcement are TransCanada Chief Executive Russell Girling and Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions. Expedited approval of projects is part of Trump’s approach for a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure package he promised on the campaign trail. The White House is looking for ways to speed up approvals and permits for infrastructure projects, which can sometimes take years to go through the maze of regulatory requirements. “It does fit into the overall strategy the president has for infrastructure,” the official said. The multibillion-dollar Keystone pipeline would bring more than 800,000 barrels per day of heavy crude from Canada’s oil sands in Alberta into Nebraska, linking to an existing pipeline network feeding U.S. refineries and ports along the Gulf of Mexico.  Approvals are still needed from state regulators, and the pipeline could face legal challenges. Conservatives have said they support quick approval. Nick Loris, an energy and environment researcher at the Heritage Foundation, said on Thursday that approval would “re-establish some certainty and sanity to a permitting process that was hijacked by political pandering.” Environmental groups that have opposed the pipeline have said they will continue the fight with petitions, political pressure and mass protests.",politicsNews,"March 24, 2017 ",1
10735,U.S. to push for greater fiscal spending at G20: Treasury official,"The United States will call on G20 countries this week to use fiscal policy in order to boost global demand, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Monday. “We will urge greater use of policy space, including fiscal space, to bolster global demand. That would lead to strengthened confidence and I would expect reduce volatility,” the Treasury official said in a preview call with reporters ahead of a G20 meeting later this week in Shanghai, China. G20 finance ministers, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, and central bank governors will meet on Feb. 26-27, with sagging global growth, divergent monetary policies and currency devaluations set to dominate the agenda. While there, the United States will also urge all members to refrain from manipulating exchange rates for competitive purposes, in line with existing G20 commitments, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “I see those commitments as being a strong indication from G20 members that they will manage their currencies in ways that are globally consistent. I think that those commitments are very, very important,” the official said. Lew has repeatedly called on China to more clearly communicate its currency policies and actions amid uncertainty over Beijing’s transition to a market-determined exchange rate. Recent Chinese efforts to improve its communications have been constructive, the official said. China’s economic slowdown has also skittered financial markets as it seeks to rebalance its economy toward consumption-led growth.  The senior Treasury official said that supply-side reforms in China were “crucial” as it pivots to a stronger services sector, and praised the country’s ongoing efforts to reduce excess capacity. Lew is scheduled to travel to Beijing for two days immediately following the G20 gathering, where he will meet with senior Chinese government officials, Treasury said in a statement.  In those meetings he will urge China to “follow through” on its commitment to market-based economic reforms, the senior Treasury official said.  On Friday, IMF chief Christine Lagarde called on G20 officials to focus on global economic spillovers from their policy decisions. An increasing number of central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, have turned to negative interest rates over the past year in order to avoid deflation and promote economic growth.",politicsNews,"February 22, 2016 ",0

1727,Republican unity on U.S. tax overhaul shows sign of fraying,"Republican efforts to unite the White House, Senate and House of Representatives behind a single tax reform plan appeared to be unraveling on Thursday, when one of the “Big Six” negotiators said the group would not dictate tax policy in the Senate.    At the outset of a congressional hearing on tax reform, Senator Orrin Hatch said the Senate Finance Committee he chairs would not be a rubber stamp for the other congressional Republican leaders and senior aides to President Donald Trump who make up the select group that has been working on a tax reform framework for months. The Big Six is preparing to release its framework on Sept. 25, a release that will sound the starting gun for Hatch’s panel and the House Ways and Means Committee to produce tax reform legislation that is now expected in October. Overhauling the U.S. tax code is a top priority of Trump and congressional Republicans, who campaigned on it last year. They have made little progress since taking power in Washington in January via a closed-door process that has excluded Democrats. “The group – some have deemed us the Big Six – will not dictate the direction we take in this committee,” Hatch said. “The Finance Committee will not be bound by any previous tax reform proposal or framework when we start putting our bill together.” Some analysts viewed the Utah Republican’s comments as the beginning of what could be a widening rift among Republicans in the Senate, House and White House that could jeopardize hopes of completing the first overhaul of the tax code in 31 years before January. “Disagreements over both substance and process are driving a wedge between senior House Republicans involved in the tax-writing process and their Senate counterparts,” Henrietta Treyz of investment advisory firm Veda Partners said in a report.  But House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, Hatch’s congressional counterpart, described potential divergence as a natural and even healthy development that would be kept in check by common ground on major tax issues. “We’ll work this out by the end of the year,” Brady told reporters. “At the end of the day, we just have to sit down and find common ground.” Hatch and Brady are among the Big Six, which also includes Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn. There have already been two statements of general tax principles from Republicans: a one-page document from the Trump administration in April and a joint statement from the Big Six negotiators in July. Democrats have criticized Republican plans as too favorable to the wealthiest Americans and corporations. With the latest blueprint due in less than two weeks, Brady and Mnuchin appeared to differ on Thursday over how much detail the document would contain. Brady told a policy forum that he did not expect the document to offer specifics on tax rates, while Mnuchin said the plan would contain extensive details including a specific corporate rate. Brady later told reporters that talks continued over what the document would contain.     “It is still clearly possible that tax reform could be enacted over the next near. However, the signs are not particularly positive at the moment,” analyst Jan Hatzius of investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a research note on Thursday. After months of talks, basic questions on the Republican tax plan remain unanswered, such as whether or not the tax cuts they want will expand the U.S. budget deficit. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday that the tax reform plan would be revenue neutral, if economic growth spurred by the legislation is taken into account. Revenue neutrality is fast emerging as a divisive issue in Congress, where deficit hawks have expressed misgivings about adding to the deficit.  In White House meetings with top Democrats in recent days, Trump has shown a new willingness to deal with the opposition.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi talked about tax reform with Trump after their Wednesday discussion on immigration, according to Representative Richard Neal, the top Ways and Means Democrat. Neal said the White House appeared to be “in synch” with Democrats for now on tax relief for the middle class. “I think that there could be some room there for conversation,” he told the same policy forum where Brady spoke.",politicsNews,"September 14, 2017 ",0
10880,Ohio House passes bill to deny funds to Planned Parenthood,"Ohio state legislators on Wednesday passed a bill blocking state and federal funds for groups that perform or promote abortions, effectively cutting $1.3 million annually used by Planned Parenthood clinics for HIV testing, pre-natal care and other programs. Governor John Kasich, a Republican presidential candidate, is expected to sign the bill, which the state Senate had already passed. House Bill 294, which passed 59 to 32, blocks women’s health providers that also provide abortions, or groups that refer patients to those providers, from receiving funds from a variety of state and federal grants.  Planned Parenthood said the bill would hinder lower-income women’s access to testing for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV tests and well-baby programs. According to its website, Planned Parenthood has 20 clinics in Ohio. Two provide abortions and all provide abortion referral. With most Republicans keen to deny funds to Planned Parenthood, Kasich will have the opportunity to sign the bill ahead of the party’s presidential primary on Feb. 20 in South Carolina. Joe Andrews, spokesman for Kasich, said the bill furthers Ohio’s policies. “The Ohio Department of Health had already stopped awarding state dollars to Planned Parenthood and they were kicked to the back of the line for the federal government’s family planning grants that the department administers. This bill further reinforces Ohio’s policies,” Andrews said Wednesday. Opponents of the bill accused state Republicans of grandstanding, noting that the timing of its passage was convenient for Kasich as he campaigns in a crowded field for nomination to represent his party in the November election.  “There’s no legitimate justification for defunding Planned Parenthood. Every excuse by legislators has been debunked,” Kellie Copeland executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, an abortion rights advocacy group, said on Wednesday. “Clearly the motivation behind the content and timing of this legislation is to bolster John Kasich’s campaign to anti-choice voters in South Carolina,” Copeland added. Proponents of the bill said the funding transfer will help combat infant mortality because it re-directs $250,000 for new parent education. Under Ohio law no state funds are used to provide abortions but state funds are used by Planned Parenthood to provide other healthcare. Rep. Kathleen Clyde, a Democrat, said the bill would be counterproductive. “It will likely increase the number of abortions in Ohio by cutting access to birth control and access to sex education in Ohio,” she said.",politicsNews,"February 10, 2016 ",0
6063,"Trump talks to U.S. automakers, pushes for new American plants","U.S. President Donald Trump urged the chief executives of the Big Three U.S. automakers on Tuesday to build more cars in the country, pressing his pledge to bring jobs to America and discourage the car industry from investing in Mexico. Trump, who has threatened to impose 35 percent tariffs on imported vehicles, opened a White House meeting with General Motors Co CEO Mary Barra, Ford Motor Co’s Mark Fields and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s Sergio Marchionne by saying he wanted to see more auto plants in the United States. In return, the new Republican president has vowed to cut regulations and taxes to make it more attractive for businesses to operate in the United States. He promised during his campaign to be a job-creating president and stressed that message in his inaugural address last Friday. “We have a very big push on to have auto plants and other plants - many other plants,” he told reporters at the start of the meeting. “It’s happening. It’s happening big league.” Matt Blunt, who heads a U.S. automaker trade association and attended the meeting, told Reuters that Trump asked what his administration could do “on domestic and trade policy that would help make the United States more competitive and strengthen the ability of automakers to add production here.” The hour-long meeting was the latest sign of Trump’s uncommon degree of intervention for a U.S. president into corporate affairs as he has repeatedly pressured automakers and other manufacturers to “buy American and hire American.” It was the first time the heads of the big three automakers met jointly with a U.S. president since a 2011 session with Barack Obama to tout a deal to nearly double fuel efficiency standards by 2025. Automakers have urged the Trump administration to rethink those aggressive mandates. The auto executives on Tuesday raised the issue of the fuel efficiency rules, trade policy and other regulatory matters, another person briefed on the meeting said. Marchionne told reporters afterward that Trump did not give them specifics on what regulations he would cut. The companies also discussed autonomous and electric vehicles and Trump asked about advanced vehicles, the person said. With flattening U.S. auto sales and excess capacity in the United States, U.S. automakers have been reluctant to open new U.S. auto plants in recent years. GM and Ford last built new U.S. assembly plants in 2004, while Fiat Chrysler opened a new transmission plant in Indiana in 2014. Kristin Dziczek, an analyst at the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research, said automakers still had excess capacity in North America after suffering in the 1990s and 2000s from overcapacity and shifts in market share. Building a new plant would take three or more years and cost at least $1 billion, industry experts said. Automakers have expanded operations at existing U.S. plants to meet rising demand for trucks and SUVs. GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler and foreign automakers have announced new U.S. jobs and investments in recent weeks.  Coinciding with Tuesday’s meeting, Toyota Motor Corp said it would add 400 jobs and invest $600 million in an Indiana plant, aiming to boost production of a popular SUV by 10 percent. Ford’s Fields said automakers wanted to work with Trump to create a “renaissance in American manufacturing” and that Trump’s economic priorities were encouraging, including his move on Monday to formally bow out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact championed by Obama.  “The mother of all trade barriers is currency manipulation. And TPP failed in meaningfully dealing with that, and we appreciate the president’s courage to walk away from a bad trade deal,” Fields told reporters after the meeting. Barra said there was a “huge opportunity” to work together with the government to “improve the environment, improve safety and improve the jobs creation.” U.S. automakers have collectively added more than 78,000 jobs since 2009, the year when GM and Chrysler, now a unit of Italian-American Fiat Chrysler, filed for bankruptcy as part of government bailouts during the U.S. recession. They have invested more than $40 billion in U.S. facilities during that period.  Despite the vocal pressure from Trump, the companies are unlikely to truly change their existing business plans for now, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting with AutoForecast Solutions. “We need to have more concrete policies from the president,” he said. “Automakers will make decisions on whether there is a solid business case. Does it make more sense to build outside the U.S. or to build in the U.S.?” GM said in 2014 it would invest $5 billion in Mexico through 2018, a move that would allow it to double its production capacity, and Barra has said the automaker is not reconsidering the plan. While automakers are adding U.S. jobs, they are also cutting U.S. production of small cars. On Monday, GM ended two shifts of production of small cars in Ohio and Michigan, cutting about 2,000 jobs. Barclays auto analyst Brian Johnson said in a note on Tuesday that “automakers will be willing to make a deal that would bring back jobs to the U.S. in return for a slower ramp of (fuel efficiency) targets and related state-level mandates.”  Auto stocks rose on Tuesday. U.S.-listed shares of Fiat Chrysler gained 5.84 percent to $10.88, while Ford was up 2.44 percent to $12.61 and GM rose 0.96 percent to $37.",politicsNews,"January 24, 2017 ",0
20082,Swedish opposition parties drops vote of no confidence in defense minister,"Sweden s center-right opposition no longer plans to bring a vote of no confidence in Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist over a botched IT outsourcing deal, after new information came to light, the alliance said.  Losing Hultqvist, one of the government s most popular ministers, would have been a blow to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, with Sweden due to hold elections in just a year s time. Other parties can still go ahead with a vote, but they would not get the majority necessary to oust him.  Lofven has already replaced two ministers in his minority center-left government over the IT deal, and the opposition had also demanded the removal of Hultqvist, who has maintained he has done nothing wrong.  However, the Liberals and the Center Party have now changed their minds, saying new information showed Hultqvist s involvement was not as serious as previously thought.   This new information means that we can t support a vote of no confidence,  Liberal Party Leader Jan Bjorklund told a news conference. Votes of no confidence are not common in Sweden. Since 1980, only seven have taken place and none of them has been successful.",worldnews,"September 14, 2017 ",0
2661,Sean Spicer Whines That SNL Was ‘Mean’ To Him And Demands They Mock Him Less,"Just like Donald Trump, White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer can t handle being satirized on Saturday Night Live.Melissa McCarthy delivered a devastatingly brilliant performance as Spicer, who has embarrassed himself himself repeatedly during press briefings by attacking the media for accurately covering Trump and his administration.Most infamously, Spicer was sent out to lecture and shame the press the day after the inauguration about the accurate assessment of Trump s crowd size on inauguration day. Spicer claimed that the crowd at Trump s ceremony was the largest in history and people around the world laughed because all the evidence shows that Trump s crowd size was clearly one of the smallest.Spicer has also feuded with CNN during the briefings.McCarthy did a fantastic job portraying Spicer during a press briefing.Here s the video via YouTube.Well, Spicer was at the Super Bowl in Houston on Sunday and he was asked about the skit.And let s just say that Spicer is a snowflake who thinks Saturday Night Live is being  mean. According to Extra,Explaining that he d first heard about the sketch while leaving church Sunday morning, Spicer said his texts had been blowing up so much he thought there must be a national emergency.Spicer told  Extra  exclusively he felt the impression was a little exaggerated. His advice was that McCarthy  needs to slow down on the gum chewing; way too many pieces in there.  Though he thought it was a really  funny  show, he felt that McCarthy  could dial back  a bit.Last night, Alec Baldwin was back as President Trump as well. As for what he thought of Alec s portrayal of the President, Spicer had the same feelings as the Leader of the Free World, calling it  mean.  Spicer said,  Alec has gone from funny to mean, and that s unfortunate.  SNL  used to be really funny. There s a streak of meanness now that they ve crossed over to mean. Seriously, Trump and his team need to grow a thicker skin if they hope to make it through the next four years without ending up with high blood pressure.Spicer apparently doesn t realize that a little exaggeration mixed with truth is what makes great satire work. As for his claim that Saturday Night Live is  mean,  I don t remember Spicer ever complaining about SNL making fun of President Obama. In fact, I don t recall him ever complaining about the many truly awful things Republicans said about President Obama over the last eight years in real life.Saturday Night Live is a comedy show. If Trump and Spicer can t handle being mocked, they should both resign because if they can t deal with comedians how are they going to handle it when world leaders criticize them? Judging by their reaction to SNL, not very well.Featured image via screenshot",News,"February 6, 2017",0
7279,Which GOP Candidate Is The Least Worst? Bill Maher Drinks Bleach And HILARIOUSLY Decides (VIDEO),"Are you having a hard time figuring out whether Donald Trump or Ted Cruz is the least awful GOP candidate in the presidential race? Bill Maher has you covered.During his New Rules segment, the Real Time host mentioned that Republicans come up to him all the time   even in the bathroom   and ask him for a hand.So Maher decided to settle the question of which Republican candidate is the least worst once and for all.First, he went over the differences between the two. Comparing them is apples and orange,  Maher quipped. Donald Trump is like Ebola. He ll violently kill you right away. Cruz is more like the Zika virus. We won t see the damage until future generations.Donald Trump wants to build a wall to keep out creepy foreigners. Ted Cruz is proof we need it.Ted Cruz has a daughter who doesn t want him to touch her, whereas Donald Trump s daughter is fine with it. Maher went on to say that while Trump is thin-skinned and reacts to every bad thing said about him, Ted Cruz  is immune to insult  because he is used to be hated by everyone all the time. Republicans, I feel your pain,  Maher declared.  You re stuck between a rock and a gross place. The House of A*shole or the House of Douchebag. Team Werewolf or Team Vampire. Verizon or AT&T. But we have to accept that being a grown-up means hard choices between disgusting options. And with that being said, Maher dramatically picked Ted Cruz as the least worst choice for the Republican nominee and washed his mouth out with bleach.Maher explained his choice by pointing out that Donald Trump is  a lunatic  who might  disappear people  like him.  The President signs off on a kill list every day and sends out the drones and I like going outside,  Maher said before reluctantly putting on a hat that says  Better Ted Than Dead.

3550,Joe Biden Makes BIG News About 2020 Election,"The results of the disappointing 2016 presidential election aren t even official yet, but Vice President Joe Biden is already making noise about 2020. Known for bucking the rules and speaking from his gut, the outgoing vice-president hinted that he might be up for another fight four years from now.CNN asked him jokingly if he planned to run for office again. Yeah, I am. I m going to run in 2020,  Biden responded.When asked for what position, Biden responded,  For president. What the hell, man. When CNN told Biden it was planning to publish his quotes, the vice president responded,  That s okay. No, I ve enjoyed every minutes of my time here in the Senate. It s a great feeling to come back. I love this place. Biden later clarified,  I m not committing not to run. I m not committing to anything. I learned a long time ago fate has a strange way of intervening. Biden is leaving office one of the most popular political figures in America, and that popularity is even higher among Democrats. Biden is seen by many as a Democrat who excels at speaking to working class families across the racial spectrum, but still has a history of legislative experience as success as a Senator from Delaware and then as a two-term Vice President.Biden would likely be able to tap into existing Democratic donors if he ran, as he has near 100% name recognition domestically and internationally. Besides First Lady Michelle Obama, he would probably be the public figure to benefit most from an association with President Obama.Biden considered running in the 2016 election, but decided against it after the tragic death of his son Beau Biden. Since then, President Obama has put Biden in charge of the  moon shot  effort to find a cure for cancer, while Biden endorsed and heavily campaigned for Secretary Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.Featured image via Flickr",News,"December 5, 2016",0
8345,Colbert Lays Waste To Fallen Candidates After Iowa In This Hilarious ‘Tribute’ (VIDEO),"The Iowa caucuses have come and gone, leaving in their wake a trail of fallen candidates no longer willing to have their dignity handed to them by the likes of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Not that Republicans have any actual dignity, so let s just go with the idea that they re tired of being embarrassed.Who can blame them? Mike Huckabee was the first to fall, joking that it wasn t due to low votes but to illness.  The voters are sick of me,  said the Huckster. Waka waka. Buh bye. Rand Paul went down in flames shortly thereafter, deciding to make sure he doesn t lose his senate seat instead, which is a valid concern.For the Democrats, Martin O malley dropped out, which comes as no surprise to anyone.That leaves the two major contenders for the Democrats and a still ridiculously large field of horrible governors, senators who don t bother voting and a few non-politician types who don t understand the first thing about how the real world works.Even with the dropouts and a Cruz victory proving devastating to Donald Trump, the real loser of the Iowa caucuses was Jeb Bush, who outspent every by dropping more than $12 million and walking away with votes in the single digits. None of the  establishment  favorites fared well with the exception of Marco Rubio, who stepped up in the absence of Donald Trump at the last Fox News debate and screamed at America every time he was given the chance.It s a circus for sure. Luckily, we have people like Stephen Colbert who know how to take the ridiculously irritating Republican field and turn them into the buffoons they are for our enjoyment.

6632,It Finally Happened: KKK Grand Imperial Wizard Endorses Donald Trump,"All the months of speculation that the modern day KKK does indeed endorse Donald Trump can be confirmed as the terrorist organization s Rebel Brigade Knights Grand Imperial Wizard endorses the GOP frontrunner on live national television.When asked by reporter Chris Thomas who would be the best one for the job of President of the United States, the Wizard answered: I think Donald Trump would be best for the job. The reason a lot of Klan members like Donald Trump is because a lot of what he believes in, we believe in. We want our country to be safe. Under the guise of now being a  political  group, the word  safe  has now become synonymous with xenophobia, Islamophobia, racism and bigotry   all tenets, still, of the KKK, no matter how they want to word it.And they re pretty much endorsing Donald Trump.To make it even better, the Klan has (apparently) had success in recruiting since President Obama has been in office   and it has nothing to do with being black, so says the Grand Wizard.  It s merely a difference in politics. Totally.And if that wasn t strange (and stupid) enough, the Grand Wizard also admitted should Trump lose the nomination, they would back Kasich, not Cruz, for President. Why? Because Ted Cruz wasn t born on American soil. In their eyes, he s a foreigner who isn t fit to be president, even though they share a lot of the same views.Again, this is purely political and absolutely nothing to do with being a racist, xenophobic bigot.So now that there seems to be plurality of KKK members rushing to embrace Trump, is to fair to say he s the candidate for racist America?Let s see how long it takes him to disavow this endorsement. It took Clinton one day to disavow the phony Koch  endorsement.  If it s any indication, his rejection of David Duke took two weeks and much consideration.I wonder how much consideration this will take.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images",News,"April 29, 2016",0

They see horror stories, they see events you couldn t see in a movie, nobody would believe it. First of all, if Trump needs to talk about who has a mental health problem, he should just look in the mirror to see a clear narcopath. However, I m sure he s the best narcopath ever.Secondly, he needs to STFU about Veterans and PTSD. Like, right now. To say it s just because they  can t handle it  and that s why they commit suicide or have a lot of struggles isn t just woefully naive, it s absolutely insulting to our men and women who have laid their life on the line for this country.However, not letting Trump get away with being the ass that he is, Patton Oswalt took to Twitter to do what he does best, roast the a**hole.Oswalt tweeted out:Hey @realDonaldTrump: Good luck with your PTSD after Hillary stomps your dick in the dirt on Nov. 8th. #bonespurs #coward #draftdodger  Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) October 3, 2016Really couldn t have said it any better than that.

15264,"Deep in Yemen war, Saudi fight against Iran falters","At a hospital in the Yemeni city of Marib, demand for artificial limbs from victims of the country s war is so high that prosthetics are made on site in a special workshop. A soldier with an artificial arm hitches up his robe to reveal a stump where his leg once was. He is angry that authorities have done little to help him since he was wounded.   I was at the front and a mortar exploded near me. We fought well, but now I get no salary, no support from the government or anyone. They just left us,  said Hassan Meigan. More than two years into a war that has already left 10,000 dead, regional power Saudi Arabia is struggling to pull together an effective local military force to defeat the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement that has seized large parts of Yemen. The dysfunction is a reminder to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that his campaign to counter arch-enemy Iran in the Middle East, including threats against Tehran s ally Hezbollah, may be hard to implement. During a rare visit to a large area of Yemeni territory controlled by the pro-Saudi government, journalists saw a patchwork of mutually suspicious army units, whose loyalty to disparate regions and commanders has hindered their war against Houthi fighters. Some soldiers appeared to be hunkering down in their bases rather than joining the fight. Those who do fight say salaries go unpaid for months. The front lines have barely moved for months. Saudi Arabia has sought to create a unified military force based in Marib, but these troops have failed to eject the Houthis from the nearby capital Sanaa, where the Saudis see the rebels as a threat to their national security. With Saudi politics in turmoil after a wave of high-profile arrests and Iranian influence growing, Yemeni officers recognize the importance of an effective army but acknowledge that success still eludes them.  Empowering the National Army and unifying all weapons and authority under it is our goal. This is what we re trying to accomplish so we can end the war with a military victory,  Brigadier General Marzooq al-Seyadi, a top Yemeni commander, told Reuters.  The difficulties until now in achieving this in the face of local and ideological factors have posed problems ... but with the aid of the Arab Coalition and the United States, which provides daily advice and support to our side, we will succeed.  A coalition spokesman, Colonel Turki al-Malki, said in September that the mission was to back Yemen  whether it s inside the country by supporting the Yemeni National Army or defending the borders and territory of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . Sunni Saudi Arabia has led the mostly Gulf Arab coalition against the Shi ite Houthis, since they seized the Yemeni capital and fanned out across the country. But the Houthis  rump state in Yemen s Western highlands has weathered thousands of Saudi-led air strikes that have been aided by refueling and intelligence from the United States. Denying they are a pawn of Iran, the Houthis say they are fighting to fend off a mercenary army in the thrall of the Gulf and the West. The group launched a missile toward Riyadh s main airport on Saturday, which Saudi Arabia said was a declaration of war by Tehran. But after years of fighting that have ravaged the deeply poor country with hunger and disease, even some of Saudi Arabia s staunchest allies in Yemen say they are angry at being manipulated from abroad.  We re fighting as proxies ... (Western powers) can end the war in Yemen. They can pressure Iran and Saudi Arabia, solve their issues and their differences,  said Ali Abd-Rabbu al-Qadhi, a lawmaker and tribal leader from Marib.  It s Yemeni blood that s being shed ... We re one society with common roots and one religion, but the international conflict has brought us to where we are,  said al-Qadhi, who wore a holstered pistol over his traditional Yemeni sarong. Despite the lack of progress on the battlefield, some soldiers on the dusty streets of Marib appeared eager to fight.  Onward to Sanaa, God willing!  smiled Abdullah al-Sufi, 20, whose khaki fatigues hung loose on his gangly frame.  We know there are foreign conspiracies on Yemeni soil, there are problems, there are setbacks. But we are fighting for our country and for our homes, that s the important thing.  As war started in March 2015, after Saudi Prince Mohammed sent in troops, Yemen s most powerful units had already sided with Houthi militiamen to rain rockets and tank fire on Marib, which the fledgling new army and allied tribes repelled. In the most ambitious military adventure in their history, troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates took part in that fight, but were stung by scores of combat deaths. The Arab forces have largely pulled back to a support role in bases far from the front line. Now units trained by Saudi Arabia fight in scattered theaters with little obvious coordination, loyal to different parties and local leaders in a society awash with guns and notorious for its fickle politics. The kingdom supports brigades adhering to Sunni Islam s puritanical Salafi school in Western Yemen, while also backing the Muslim Brotherhood around Marib and loyalists of exiled President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in the south. Additionally, the United Arab Emirates, - the other key Gulf power in the anti-Iran war effort in Yemen - has armed and trained formidable units across southern and eastern Yemen. To add to the confusion, these fighters despise the Houthis as well as pro-Saudi units in northern Yemen.  Displayed on walls all over Marib, portraits of slain soldiers are captioned with poems praising them as  martyrs  and  lions.   My son is sixteen. He said  dad, give me a gun, I want to fight.  He goes to the front now. No father is happy with this, but what can we do? This is a war, this is the situation we re in,  said one Marib veteran. Yemen s government also appears to be living through difficult times. President Hadi has been in Riyadh since being ejected from his country by the Houthis, and sources said his hosts have banned him from traveling for over a month, citing poor security in Yemen. Officials in his office denied the reports. But the Saudi response this week to the Houthi ballistic missile - to close all ports, borders and airspace, the majority of which are nominally under Hadi s control - appeared to deal an unprecedented rebuke to their ally. Activist Khalid Baqlan expressed the fear of many young people and professionals that the errors of a weak government and foreign powers were hollowing out Yemeni society.   What we re seeing is not the building of real state institutions but the empowerment of groups with competing agendas who could fight in the future, benefiting no one,  said Baqlan, from the Saba Youth Council, a civil society group.  There has to be a political solution, it s the only way to save the country.  Yemen's stalemated war: tmsnrt.rs/2zshXBc",worldnews,"November 9, 2017 ",0
468,Democratic Representative Gutierrez hints at 2020 U.S. presidential run,"U.S. Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez, who has announced he will not seek re-election to Congress in 2018, said on Wednesday he wanted to concentrate his energies “on the national level” and indicated he might be interested in a presidential run in 2020.  Fox News reported earlier on Wednesday that Gutierrez was weighing such a bid. When asked by Reuters if he planned to run, Gutierrez, who has represented Chicago in the U.S. House of Representatives for the past quarter century, said he wanted to spend the first six months of 2018 touring the country “talking with as many people as possible.” “Does it mean going to Iowa? I certainly hope so,” Gutierrez said in an interview. Iowa traditionally holds the first Democratic and Republican party nominating contests for president. Candidates weighing presidential candidacies typically pay visits to the state well before they formally enter the race. “But it also means going to California and visiting farm workers there and visiting with farm workers in Florida ... and in Oregon and in Washington (state) and visiting with immigrant communities,” Gutierrez said. “I’m not retiring. I want to change my focus. I want to take my energy on a national level,” he said. “I can tell you that very, very clearly.”  Republican President Donald Trump already has expressed his intention to seek re-election in 2020. While incumbent presidents often are favored to win, Democrats see Trump as particularly vulnerable given his low approval ratings in opinion polls. That has spurred speculation that many candidates could weigh challenging him. Former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, for example, has sent signals that he may run. Gutierrez, a 63-year-old lawmaker of Puerto Rican descent,  has made immigration reform a signature issue. In August, he was arrested outside the White House while taking part in a protest against Trump’s decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protects young people brought to the United States illegally as children. Gutierrez has sharply criticized the Trump administration’s response to the devastation in Puerto Rico from Hurricanes Maria and Irma. Gutierrez said he would explore possible campaign fundraising efforts. Although he would run as a Democrat, he would not seek the blessing of the Democratic Party establishment. “I’m not talking to DNC (Democratic National Committee) officials. I’m not going to talk to anybody within the Democratic Party structures because what I want to do is create a party structure independent of the Democratic Party,” he said. Regardless of whether he seeks the White House, Gutierrez said he wanted to play a big role in 2020 helping to encourage voting and political activism among Hispanics, a growing demographic group that leans strongly Democratic. When word leaked out that he was retiring from Congress, there was speculation Gutierrez might be planning a run for governor of Puerto Rico. On Wednesday, Gutierrez rejected the idea. “If it was president of the Republic of Puerto Rico, it would certainly be different,” said Gutierrez, who favors independence for the U.S. territory.",politicsNews,"November 29, 2017 ",0
15070,Xi tells Duterte China will work to safeguard South China Sea peace,"China will work with Southeast Asian countries to safeguard peace in the South China Sea, President Xi Jinping said on Saturday in a meeting with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who pledged to handle issues with Beijing in those waters bilaterally. China claims almost the entire strategic waterway through which about $3 trillion worth of goods pass every year, building and militariszing artificial islands. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have conflicting claims there.  China will continue to work with ASEAN countries to safeguard peace, stability and prosperity of the South China Sea region,  China s official Xinhua news agency cited Xi as saying to Duterte. The two met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the Vietnamese resort city of Danang. The Philippines will, according to a consensus reached by both sides, work through bilateral channels to appropriately handle maritime issues, Xinhua cited Duterte as saying. It did not elaborate. Duterte said earlier in the week that he planned to ask China to make clear its intentions in the South China Sea. Since coming to office 16 months ago, the firebrand leader has been conciliatory to Beijing, despite a ruling by an international arbitration court favoring the Philippines in its territorial dispute with China. In the past, Duterte has repeatedly said he will raise the sea dispute at the proper time and avoided the issue when Manila hosted two regional meetings this year. The United States has criticized China s construction of islands and its build-up of military facilities in the sea, and is concerned they could be used to restrict free nautical movement. U.S. Navy ships have also carried out freedom of navigation patrols in the area, angering China, which says the territorial issues should be handled directly between countries in the region.",worldnews,"November 11, 2017 ",1
2218,"Trump Just Did Something REALLY Weird On Twitter, And It Makes Him Look EXTREMELY Shady (IMAGE)","Donald Trump really doesn t make sticky situations any better for himself.Trump s entanglements with Russia continue to be a growing story, and a more recent piece to this puzzle came into play as Trump s Attorney General Jeff Sessions was accused of perjury over his communications with Russia. But if Trump was somehow trying to clean up his image and maintain a low profile, the fact that he  liked  a tweet about Senator Al Franken accusing Sessions of perjury certainly isn t going to help:The fact that Trump would publicly  like  a story about one of his biggest scandals only proves how insane he is. Every part of the Fox News story that Trump is calling attention to is negative, and portrays Sessions as someone who lied under oath because all of his arguments were so weak. And that s not all  the story shows that there was a THIRD time Sessions made contact with Russia, when before only two had been reported.To make this even more bizarre, Trump decided to like this story on the very day a poll was released that revealed most Americans were in agreement that Sessions lied under oath and should resign.Either Trump really thinks he s going to get away with all of this no matter how bold he is, or he s really that stupid. Considering that these actions are coming from the same man that bragged about how he could go out on a popular New York street and shoot someone without losing any votes, he really just might be that confident that he is going to skate by all of these accusations and investigations. Trump has never been one for subtlety, and he probably enjoys pushing the envelope and seeing what he can actually get away with. He needs to stop making fools out of the American people, and he must be held accountable for his actions.",News,"March 9, 2017",1
8280,U.S. lawmakers question Mylan's Medicaid EpiPen rebates,"Two key U.S. congressional committee members on Friday called for an investigation into whether Mylan NV, under fire for raising the price of its EpiPen device, overcharged the government’s low-income healthcare program for the allergy treatment. In a letter to the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Frank Pallone, both Democrats, seek clarification of whether EpiPen was classified as a generic, “non-innovator” drug, or a brand-name drug by the Medicaid program. Under current law, branded drugs, and generic drugs available from a single source, are required to pay a rebate amount of at least 23.1 percent of the average manufacturer price. Generic drugs are subject to a much lower 13 percent rebate. Mylan, in an emailed statement, said it has complied with all laws and regulations regarding Medicaid rebates, and intends to file with regulators, by next April as required under new guidelines, for EpiPen to be classified as a “non-innovator” product. The device jabs a dose of the drug epinephrine into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions such as to peanuts, food allergies and bee stings.  Mylan, whose tax address is in the Netherlands but which has corporate headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, has raised the U.S. price of EpiPen from less than $100 when it acquired the product in 2007 to more than $600. Amid an outcry by parents, consumer groups and U.S. politicians, the company said on Monday it will soon launch the first generic version of the device for $300, half the list price of its branded product.  Wyden, ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, and Pallone, ranking member of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, said in the letter on Friday: “It has recently come to our attention that Mylan has classified EpiPen as a generic drug” under the Medicaid rebate program, even though it is considered a new drug by the Food and Drug Administration. Shares of Mylan, which fell 4.7 percent to close at $39.97 on Friday, have dropped 19 percent since mid-August.",politicsNews,"September 2, 2016 ",1
20513,Havana braced for floods after Hurricane Irma rakes Cuban keys,"Hurricane Irma uprooted trees and tore off roofs in Cuba on Saturday with 125-mile-per-hour (200-km per hour) winds that damaged hotels in the island s best-known beach resorts and forced evacuations as far along the coast as low-lying areas of the capital Havana.  Power was out and cellphone service was spotty in many regions as Irma neared the end of a 200-mile (320-km) trek westwards along the top of the island. It was forecast to head north toward Florida in the evening. In the fishing town of Caibarien, residents swept mud from beachside homes after storm surge drove 3 feet (1 meter) of seawater up the shore. In streets carpeted with fresh green seaweed as the water receded, people said it was the strongest cyclone ever to hit the town.   Sheets of zinc that came flying into our backyard also damaged the kitchen wall and we lost many roof tiles,  said Angel Coya, 52, adding he was optimistic that Cuba s Communist government would help repair the damage.  We have to keep on.  Irma s turn northward was expected to occur around 150 miles (240 km) east of the capital. Nevertheless, authorities shut off power in large parts of the city and evacuated some 10,000 people from central Havana near the Malecon seawall because of fears of flooding from the storm surge. By Saturday evening, the sea had penetrated two blocks over parts of the city s historic seafront boulevard, and the waters were expected to advance farther as the surge grew. Restaurants on the seaside drive pulled down their shutters and stacked sandbags against the storm. Still, many Cubans expressed a sense of relief after the eye of the first Category 5 storm to make landfall on the island since 1932 passed over the northern keys, just grazing the mainland with its full force.  Honestly, I expected worse. I thought I would come back and find the roof gone,  said Yolexis Domingo, 39, using a machete to hack the branches off a tree that fell in front of his house in Caibarien.  Still, it is going to be a while before I can come back to live here. The water came up to a meter high and some of the roof flew off.  Overnight, the storm pounded the chain of pristine keys and tourism resorts that stretch along the coast from central Camaguey province to Villa Clara province, and it was headed toward Varadero, Cuba s most famous beach getaway.  Cayos Coco and Guillermo, the crown jewels of what is known as the King s Gardens, with 16 hotels frequented by Canadian and European tourists, sustained serious damage, local authorities in the area said.  At least one bridge on a causeway to the area collapsed, and the communications tower for the keys was no longer standing. Dozens of coastal towns were damaged, with some reports of collapsed houses, though no deaths had been reported.  This is a beautiful town but now it is a disaster,  said local resident Sandro Sanchez, 27, walking through the main square after the hurricane had passed Remedios, in Villa Clara. Corrugated iron from roofs were strewn in the streets alongside rubble. Lampposts were bent double, plant pots smashed and the fronds of palm trees shredded.  You can t do anything against nature,  he said.  We never had a storm wreak so much damage here. This is really a mess.  On Saturday, Irma covered most of the island, the Caribbean s largest. Its force sent shockwaves and flooding inward. In the city of Camaguey, Anaida Morales said she just been through a night from hell with her mom, stepson and husband.      The trees in the park in front of my house are down and others strewn all over the streets. Lots of roofs are gone and some houses collapsed. The river that runs through the city is about to flood,  she said.  The wind roared all night and it is still strong. I couldn t sleep. I m scared of hurricanes and this is the worst I have been through,  she said. Morales said she made a phone call to her daughter, who shares her name, in Florida, where millions of people were preparing for Irma s arrival.  I just spoke to Anaida, it is hard to believe she is getting ready to go through the same thing I just did,  she said.",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",1
3429,Ex-FBI chief Comey to testify next week in Russia probe,"Former FBI Director James Comey will testify next Thursday before a U.S. Senate panel investigating Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, in a hearing that could add to difficulties facing President Donald Trump. In his first public appearance since Trump fired him on May 9, Comey will address the Senate Intelligence Committee in both an open session and behind closed doors, which would allow him to discuss classified information, the committee said on Thursday. Comey was leading the FBI’s probe into the allegations, and his firing sparked a political uproar. Facing rising pressure, the Justice Department last month named Robert Mueller, another former FBI chief, as a special counsel to investigate the matter. The Justice Department and multiple U.S. congressional committees are investigating Russia’s actions in the 2016 presidential election and questions about possible collusion between Russian officials and Trump campaign associates. At next week’s hearing, Comey is expected to be asked about conversations in which Trump is reported to have pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, whose ties to Russia are under scrutiny. Controversy erupted again this week after the Republican head of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, approved subpoenas to the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency for information relating to the “unmasking” of the names of Trump campaign advisers inadvertently picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts. The White House and Nunes have alleged that former Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration eavesdropped on Trump’s campaign, an assertion that Comey has disputed and current U.S. officials dismiss as absurd. Four current and former U.S. officials who have reviewed the materials told Reuters there was no evidence that political motives drove Obama’s aides to request the names be unredacted. “There is no substance to this, so the only way to look at it is as an attempt to distract the headlines and the public from Comey’s public testimony and Mueller’s investigation, both of which are serious,” said one of the U.S. officials familiar with the information Nunes subpoenaed. Committee aides complained Nunes had acted unilaterally, and the top Democrat on the panel, Representative Adam Schiff, said Nunes’ actions violated his earlier decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Democratic Representative Jackie Speier said it appeared that Nunes was “more concerned with pushing the White House narrative than seeking the truth.”  Trump on Thursday renewed his allegation, without citing evidence, that his campaign communications were monitored, saying in a tweet: “The big story is the ‘unmasking and surveillance’ of people that took place during the Obama administration.” Nunes followed suit hours later, tweeting: “Seeing a lot of fake news from media elites and others who have no interest in violations of Americans’ civil liberties via unmaskings.” The names of U.S. citizens mentioned in foreign communications intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies are normally redacted, or “masked,” in intelligence reports. The requests to unmask the names of Trump associates underwent the same stringent evaluations that U.S. privacy laws and intelligence regulations require for all such applications, and they produced nothing out of the ordinary, said the four officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. At most, only one of the requests related to Russia in any way, and the rest pertained to other countries, two of them said. The requests involved between 30 and 40 top-secret reports on intercepted communications in which foreign officials outside the United States mentioned the Trump campaign and people involved in it, the officials said. The reports contained no evidence that any Americans were targets of U.S. eavesdropping operations, they said. Russia has repeatedly denied any effort to interfere in the U.S. election, but Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday some Russians might have acted on their own without their government’s involvement. Trump has denied any collusion between Russia and his campaign. He has repeatedly questioned the U.S. intelligence finding that Putin directed an operation that included computer hacking, fake news and propaganda intended to swing the election in Trump’s favor against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.",politicsNews,"June 1, 2017 ",1
19058,Trump travel ban on more solid ground as top court cancels hearing,"The Supreme Court signaled on Monday it may dismiss a challenge to President Donald Trump s controversial travel ban after the White House announced tailored restrictions on eight countries that legal experts said stand a better chance at holding up in court.  The high court canceled oral arguments scheduled for Oct. 10 to decide whether or not a March 6 executive order that temporarily blocked travel from six Muslim-majority countries was discriminatory. That ban expired on Sunday. The president replaced it with a proclamation that indefinitely restricts travel from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea. Certain government officials from Venezuela will also be barred. The new ban, Trump s third, could affect tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors.  Trump has been trying for most of the year to create a ban that passes court muster. The Sunday proclamation, which he said is needed to screen out terrorist or public safety threats, could be less vulnerable to legal attack, scholars and other experts said, because it is the result of a months-long analysis of foreign vetting procedures by U.S. officials.  It also might be less easily tied to Trump s campaign-trail statements some courts viewed as biased against Muslims.   The greater the sense that the policy reflects a considered, expert judgment, the less the temptation (by courts) to second-guess the executive,  said Saikrishna Prakash, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, in an email. It looks less like a matter of prejudice or a desire to fulfill a campaign promise.  In its brief order, the high court asked the Trump administration and the ban s challengers, including states and refugee advocacy organizations, to file briefs on whether the case should be dismissed. Trump s March 6 ban sparked international outrage and was quickly blocked by federal courts as unconstitutional discrimination or a violation of immigration law.  In June, the Supreme Court allowed a limited version of the ban to go ahead while the justices prepared to hear arguments over its legality on Oct. 10, a date they have now scrubbed. In 2016, more than 72,000 nonimmigrant and immigrant visas were issued to the countries covered by the new ban, excluding Venezuela, with nearly half of those going to Iran. Only nine North Koreans immigrated to the United States in 2016 and 100 were granted nonimmigrant visas. The new ban is set to go into effect on Oct. 18, but it already applies to five of the six countries covered by the March 6 ban, according to a U.S. State Department cable issued on Sunday and obtained by Reuters. (To read the full cable click here: here)  Sudan was dropped from the list of banned countries after the Sudanese government provided information required under the new criteria set out by the Trump administration earlier this year, a White House official said on Monday. The government has said the president has broad authority in immigration and national security matters, but challengers to the March ban had argued that it ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution s bar on favoring one religion over another.  They cited statements Trump made during his 2016 campaign for president, including his call for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  Within hours of Sunday s proclamation, representatives for the Hawaii, New York and California attorneys general said their offices were reviewing the new restrictions. Advocacy organizations denounced it as more of the same. If the court does dismiss the case, there remains the separate issue of whether the justices will throw out the sweeping lower court rulings that invalidated the ban. The government would want to erase precedents that constrain its authority while the challengers would want to keep them in place for the same reasons.   This is still a Muslim ban. They simply added three additional countries,  said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, which previously sued to block Trump s travel ban executive orders.   Of those countries, Chad is majority Muslim, travel from North Korea is already basically frozen and the restrictions on Venezuela only affect government officials on certain visas,  Heller said.  Sudan, which was in the March order, is no longer included.  The worldwide review examined each country s ability to issue reliable electronic passports and share security risk data with the United States. Overall, 47 countries had problems, and 40 made improvements, including 11 that agreed to share information on known or suspected terrorists, Trump s proclamation said.  The review  at least arguably attenuates the link between the president s alleged bias and the policy,  said Margo Schlanger, a University of Michigan Law School professor. However, challengers potentially could argue that the expanded ban violates the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, which forbids the government from discriminating based on an individual s nationality when issuing immigrant visas.  Congress decided that it didn t want an immigration system that played favorites among countries,  Schlanger said.",worldnews,"September 25, 2017 ",0
5339,WATCH: Trump Stumbles When Asked If He Would Support Former KKK Grand Wizard (VIDEO),"Donald Trump sat down with for an interview with Chuck Todd Sunday morning during an episode of MSNBC s Meet the Press. During the interview, Todd questioned Trump on the matter of former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke. Duke has been a vocal supporter of Trump throughout the GOP primary. He is also now running for a U.S. Senate seat. Duke says that he was inspired to run for office because of Trump s campaign.Trump has previously denounced Duke s views and his endorsement of his campaign. Trump says in the interview that he does not support Duke s senatorial run. However, after a bit of grilling from Todd, Trump implies that he might vote for Duke under certain circumstances. Todd said: David Duke announced his Senate candidacy claiming your agenda for his own, or essentially saying glad that you spoke out. Newt Gingrich said, every Republican should repudiate this guy no matter what he says. Trump responds by saying  I did and I do. That s when Todd asks Trump: Would you support a Democrat over David Duke, if that was what was necessary to defeat him? Trump then says that it would depend on the Democrat who is running for office. Though he does say that he wouldn t support Duke. I guess, depending on who the Democrat was, but the answer would be yes. Look, the answer is, as quick as you can say it, rebuked. Is that OK? Rebuked. It shouldn t matter who is running against Duke, as long as they are better than Duke himself. It s nearly impossible to imagine a candidate that could be worse than Duke running on a Democratic ticket. Even if someone is a firm believer in not supporting the lesser of two evils relative to their political position, you do everything you can to support that candidate if their opponent happens to be a former leader of one of the worst hate groups in the United States.You can watch the interview below.Featured image via video screenshot",News,"July 24, 2016",1
6934,This Important Video Sums Up Why Donald Trump MUST NOT Be President,"Despite the damage that the presidency of George W. Bush and his war mongering administration did to the reputation of the United States, the world continues to look at America as a place of hope and great possibilities. This can clearly be seen with the excitement and electricity generated when Barack Obama ran for and then won the presidency. The world realizes the influence the United States exerts on the planet and thus looks very closely at our political developments, especially when it relates to presidential candidates.Thus, much of the world has been alarmed and scared by the rise of Donald Trump, a man who has promised to do all sorts of crazy thing once he becomes president. He won t rule out using nuclear weapons, he s repeatedly insulted and threatened Mexicans with his stupid wall, he wants to kick start an arms race, he wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States, Islamophobia would be state policy, and he wants to punish women who have abortions.As is stated in the video below: If Trump actually makes it to the White House, there s only one thing you can predict about this wholly unpredictable man: There will be a surge in what people will call anti-American-ism. People will mock the nation as dumb, vulgar, and aggressive. It will be like it was in the Geroge W. Bush years, only much much worse. We don t need another Bush, or someone who can actually be worse if that s even possible. Let s help keep America safe from this man by doing what we can to make sure he does not become president.Watch and share this video:Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"April 13, 2016",1
7676,Venezuela crisis enters dangerous phase as Maduro foes go militant,"In a curious convergence of events on the same day last week, four Venezuelan provincial courts issued identical rulings, state governors quickly hit Twitter to celebrate, then the election board emailed a short but bombshell statement. Opposition hopes for a referendum to recall President Nicolas Maduro were dashed, on grounds of fraud in an initial signature drive. The vote was off. For many in the opposition, that settled a years-old debate about the nature of Venezuela’s socialist government, uniting them in conviction they are now fighting a dictatorship. Their new militancy heightens the risk of unrest as the South American OPEC member of 30 million people grapples with a dangerous economic and political crisis. “Can anyone in the world now really doubt that Venezuela is living in tyranny?” said housewife Mabel Pinate, 62, dressed in white among thousands of protesters who took to the streets against Maduro on Wednesday. “We are sick of this. It’s time to toughen up and do what we must to save Venezuela,” added Pinate, whose husband was fired from state oil company PDVSA by Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez and whose two children have gone abroad. After pinning its hopes on a referendum this year - which could have triggered a presidential election and put them in power after 17 years of leftist rule - the enraged opposition Democratic Unity coalition has taken its gloves off. It is holding a symbolic political trial of Maduro in the legislature, organizing daily street protests, and shunning talks with the government that had been announced by the Vatican for this weekend.  Recalling tactics that led to a short-lived coup against Chavez in 2002 and a shutdown of the oil industry, the coalition has also called for a general strike on Friday and a march to the Miraflores presidential palace next week.  “We’ve reached the limit,” said Henrique Capriles, a usually moderate opposition leader, calling the government “Satan.” “Does the opposition have anything to negotiate with the government? Nothing. Why does the government want dialogue? Because the water has risen to its neck,” he said.  Some hardliners, most notably veteran activist Maria Corina Machado and jailed protest leader Leopoldo Lopez’ wife Lilian Tintori, are calling for Gandhi-style civil disobedience.  The government is vowing an iron fist. It says well-known troublemakers, who were behind the 2002 putsch, are again seeking a coup against an elected government, with the help of the United States and compliant foreign media. “I fear nobody and nothing!” Maduro told red-shirted supporters at one of his daily rallies and TV appearances this week. The ruling Socialist Party’s No. 2, Diosdado Cabello said any companies heeding the strike call would be seized by workers and the military. “We’re not going to allow craziness.” Long proud of its democratic credentials after winning numerous elections under Chavez, the ruling Socialist Party says it is the opposition flouting Venezuela’s democracy given that independent institutions shot down the referendum. Officials also argue that the very existence of protests and virulent public criticism of Maduro prove democracy is alive and well in Venezuela. Maduro insists the referendum decision was made by independent judges and electoral officials based on technical criteria, and denies the Socialist Party had any sway over the result. But critics say both the judiciary and electoral council have long been in the government’s pocket. The Supreme Court has repeatedly shot down legislation  passed by the opposition-dominated Congress while interpreting the constitution to favor the executive branch and limit the reach of lawmakers. And the elections council has steadily shifted the requirements for requesting the recall vote. Maduro would have faced probable defeat and removal from power if the referendum had gone ahead.  His challenge now is to contain street protests and respond to deep anger among all Venezuelans at the dreadful state of the economy. Food shortages, long shopping lines and runaway prices have eroded the ruling “Chavismo” movement’s popularity among the poor and seen Maduro’s ratings slide to just over 20 percent.  But as unhappy as they are, disaffected former “Chavistas” are not yet ready to throw their lot in en masse with coalition leaders they still view with suspicion. “They are all from privileged families. How can they represent me?” said Orlando Diaz, 47, a mechanic and father of four from a slum in western Caracas who has seen work dry up and income tumble during a nearly three-year recession. “Do I hate Maduro? Yes. He has betrayed the comandante (Chavez), he is a fool. Will I join these people in their crying and marching? No way. Frankly, I don’t know where to turn. I don’t see a future, I just have to find bread for my family today and tomorrow. That’s all I think about.” The opposition’s challenge is how to incorporate people like Diaz and his neighbors from the gritty hillside Antimano “barrio”, into their street push. On Wednesday, they drew hundreds of thousands nationwide, but students and traditional supporters remained at the vanguard. Scores of people on both sides were killed during anti-Maduro protests in 2014 and there was new violence on Wednesday, with dozens of injuries and arrests. A policemen was shot dead in an incident the government blamed on demonstrators.  “A recall referendum in 2016 would have meant the automatic exit from power of ‘Chavismo’,” said local pollster Luis Vicente Leon. “Eschewing democratic codes and values, the government preferred to assume ... the risk of a popular reaction.” The next presidential election is due at the end of 2018 and most Venezuelans assume another candidate will emerge from within “Chavismo” instead of Maduro. But given the events of recent days, opposition supporters are beginning to wonder if that election will even take place.",politicsNews,"October 27, 2016 ",1
120,Congressman will not seek relection amid misconduct probe,"U.S. Representative Ruben Kihuen announced on Saturday that he will not seek re-election, becoming the latest member of Congress to end his legislative career in the face of sexual harassment allegations.   The first-term Nevada Democrat, who is the subject of an ethics investigation in the House of Representatives, denied the allegations against him but concluded that the charges would distract from “a fair and thorough discussion of the issues” on the campaign trail. “It is in the best interests of my family and my constituents to complete my term in Congress and not seek reelection,” Kihuen, 37, said in a statement issued by his campaign committee. The news website BuzzFeed has reported allegations that Kihuen sexually harassed a staff member of his 2016 political campaign. This week, there were also multiple reports of an anonymous lobbyist’s description of his unwanted advances. Reuters has not independently confirmed the reports.  Kihuen is the latest in a growing roster of male lawmakers in Congress who have been accused of sexual misconduct amid a wave of such allegations against powerful men in entertainment, politics and the media. Lawmakers are working on legislation to update the body’s rules on sexual harassment. On Friday, Democratic Representative Bobby Scott of Virginia was accused of touching a former aide without permission and offering to advance her career in exchange for sex. The aide also said she was wrongfully dismissed from her job. Scott denied the charges. Republican Representative Blake Farenthold also said this week that he would not seek re-election after accounts surfaced that he created a hostile work environment. He denied allegations of sexual harassment but admitted allowing an unprofessional culture in his Capitol Hill office.  Last week, Democratic Representative John Conyers and Republican Representative Trent Franks resigned, while Democratic Senator Al Franken said he would step down in the coming weeks.",politicsNews,"December 16, 2017 ",0

3193,CNN Host STUNNED As Trump’s Team REFUSES To Comment On Russian Hacking (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s team certainly doesn t make it easy for the people who have to interview them. In a typical interview with Trump s team, news anchors have to constantly fact check and repeatedly bring Trump s minions back to the original questions and topics as they deflect blame and avoid answering every question.On Monday s  New Day,  CNN host Alisyn Camerota had to interview Trump spokesman Sean Spicer, and it was basically an interview from hell as Spicer wouldn t give her any responses to the most pressing questions. Camerota had tried to ask Spicer just what special information Trump claimed he knows about Russia s involvement in the US election. Spicer s response couldn t have been more insane as he said Trump gets a lot of  classified information, intelligence reports  on a daily basis (despite the fact that Trump s team once said the president-elect only gets briefings once per week). Spicer then went off topic and said Trump will wait to make conclusions about the hacking, ignoring the fact that Trump has defended Russia extensively from all blame.Camerota was unwilling to let Spicer avoid the question, and she said: I want to get back to my question. Is Mr. Trump, who said he s going to reveal something, he says he knows things. Spicer again refused to give a response, stating that Trump would talk about it himself right before blaming Obama for not talking about China s 2015 hacking. Camerota responded by fact-checking Spicer right then and there. She said: Sean, just to correct you, you say not a single statement was ever issued or made after the Chinese hacking. I have the statement right here in my hands. Spicer s response was pathetic, as he admitted to being wrong but still continued to blame Obama, accusing Obama of responding too late. Camerota tirelessly tried to bring Spicer back to her question: Sean, I m more interested in what Mr. Trump is going to do. We re not electing President Obama again. You are representing Mr. Trump. Camerota asked about Trump s plans, and Spicer couldn t provide her with anything. All he did was confess that Trump didn t have a final report. Spicer then stunned Camerota by admitting that he had lied earlier when he said Trump had been briefed: The report is not final. He s not been briefed by the heads of the intelligence community. A stunned Camerota said in disbelief,  He has not been briefed about the heads of the intelligence community about whether or not they believe Russia is behind the hacking? Spicer began to fall apart when Camerota told him to  hold on  after he accused anyone who believed  non-final  reports of being irresponsible. Spicer shouted, No! Not, hold on! The idea we re asking people and making assumptions on a report that s not final is unbelievable. The rest of the interview, Camerota was forced to constantly counter Spicer s moronic remarks. Spicer practically ended the interview by completely disrespecting Camerota for expecting that Trump and his team might at least be exploring the possibility that reports about the Russian hacking are correct. Spicer said condescendingly: I know it s frustrating for you that we re doing it in a logical way. No, we re going to get all the information, get briefed properly and make a decision. We re not going to put the cart before the horse. Camerota couldn t believe her ears. You can watch this disastrous interview below:Featured image via screenshot",News,"January 2, 2017",0

The woman who captured national attention Thursday night after she was egged at a Donald Trump rally   and then smiled about it   is asking for people to help oust the mayor of San Jose.Rachel Casey, identified by her Facebook posts, LinkedIn profile and by people who know her, posted one of at least two petitions to get Mayor Sam Liccardo to resign from his post. As of Monday, one petition, started by a man in Texas, had 3,600 supporters. Another petition, started by a man in Minnesota, also asks for the mayor s resignation, and had more than 7,000 signatures by Monday morning. The mayor had criticized Trump for whipping up the nation into an antagonistic state, but also condemned protesters for getting violent   mostly by harming the Trump camp. Liccardo responded:  I m not terribly persuaded by calls of resignation that are emanating from Texas or Minnesota. I serve at the pleasure of the residents of San Jose and am accountable to the residents of San Jose.  Efforts to reach Casey, who lists herself as a physical therapist assistant and personal trainer from Florida who moved to the Bay Area, were not immediately successful on Monday. Her former company, Boca Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine said she no longer worked there. A message left at what appears to be her home or cell was unanswered. She didn t immediately respond to a Facebook message request, which she saw, as she acknowleged two reporters trying to find her in her own post.

7354,Trump's foreign policy approach almost same as that of Putin: Kremlin,"The Kremlin said on Thursday U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s foreign policy approach was “phenomenally close” to that of President Vladimir Putin, giving Russia hope that tattered U.S.-Russia relations could gradually be improved. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, speaking in New York, said he saw incredible similarities between the two men’s foreign policy ideas, and this meant there was a solid basis to start a meaningful dialogue between Moscow and Washington.          Peskov, in the United States for a chess tournament, said he was struck by how similar parts of Trump’s victory speech were to a speech Putin gave in southern Russia last month.  Both men said they would put their own country’s national interests first, but that they would be ready to develop ties with other nations, depending on how ready other countries were to deepen relations themselves. “They (Putin and Trump) set out the same main foreign policy principles and that is incredible,” Peskov said in comments broadcast by Russian state TV’s Channel One on Thursday evening. “It is phenomenal how close they are to one another when it comes to their conceptual approach to foreign policy. And that is probably a good basis for our moderate optimism that they will at least be able to start a dialogue to start to clear out the Augean stables in our bilateral relations.”  With Moscow and Washington now at odds over Syria, Ukraine and NATO, Peskov cautioned that it would take a long time before relations could return to a high level, however, because of how far they had been allowed to deteriorate. “An atmosphere of mutual trust takes years to achieve,” he said. “It’s not possible to just declare that there is an atmosphere of mutual trust, especially after such serious damage was done in the last few years to our relations.” Peskov told the TASS news agency separately that Putin was ready to be flexible when it came to mending ties which he wanted to improve, but that there was a limit to his flexibility and that he would need to see some U.S. reciprocity. Peskov spoke after one of Russia’s most senior diplomats told the Interfax news agency earlier on Thursday that the Russian government had been in touch with members of Trump’s political team during the U.S. election campaign and knew most of his entourage.",politicsNews,"November 10, 2016 ",1
19247,BOOM! Indiana YMCA Takes CNN Off TV’s After Members Complain About “Fake News”,"The term  fake news  has become attached to some of America s major news outlets. Now a YMCA in Valparaiso, Ind., has decided to ban CNN from its TVs after customers complained the news network falsifies stories. In order to eliminate perceived political bias associated with national news outlets, the Valparaiso Family YMCA will only be showing local news channels in the future,  the Valparaiso YMCA said in a statement.Chicago Tribune reporter/columnist Jerry Davich said he asked Valparaiso YMCA CEO Robert Wanek to elaborate on why the decision was made, and Wanek responded,  I cannot pinpoint the change origins, only to add that we get dozens of requests to change channels every day from numerous interest groups. We just want the Y to be a haven for wellness where people come together and have a sense of belonging, gain new relationships and achieve their personal goals,  Wanek added.  We will display local news moving forward. Davich complained that  the Y s decision to remove all national news outlets from its televisions says more about its leaders than its members. You d think this story would be just another example of fake news. Sadly, it s not. He said he wondered if the company was  simply exercising its right to appease as many members as possible, or is the new Donald Trump-led America already flexing its muscles? YMCA member Greg Quartucci told CBS Chicago the decision to remove CNN from wellness center TVs was made shortly after Trump confronted CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta, calling his network  terrible  and  fake news.

7787,"North Carolina police probe arson, graffiti threat at Republican office","SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Police in North Carolina sought leads on Monday about a fire they believe was deliberately set at a local Republican headquarters over the weekend and a graffiti message warning the political party to “leave town or else.” Investigators are treating the incident as arson. The fire caused heavy damage to the Orange County Republican Party’s office in Hillsborough, North Carolina, about 40 miles (65 km) from the state capital of Raleigh.  “This is political terrorism,” said Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party.  Both Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton condemned the attack. North Carolina is considered a battleground state that could play a pivotal role in the Nov. 8 presidential contest. “We are taking this incident very seriously and have significant resources at the local, state and federal level committed to this investigation,” Hillsborough Police Chief Duane Hampton said in a statement on Monday, asking anyone with information to come forward. Hillsborough police said a bottle containing flammable material ignited after being thrown through a front window of the headquarters between midnight and about 9 a.m. on Sunday, when a nearby business owner reported the crime. “Someone has firebombed through the window (of) the Republican party up here beside me and sprayed all over the side of my building, ‘Nazi Republicans leave town or else,’” the caller told a 911 operator in a call released on Monday. A swastika also was spray-painted on the neighboring building, police said. They said no one was in the party office at the time, but the substance burned furniture and charred campaign signs. White House spokesman Josh Earnest praised the efforts of self-described Democrats who raised about $13,000 in an online GoFundMe campaign to help Republicans reopen the office. “That’s consistent with the values that we lift up in this country,” he said at a news briefing. “There is no justification for the use of violence to advance a political agenda.” In a tweet on Sunday, Clinton said she was grateful no one was hurt in the attack, which she called “horrific and unacceptable.” Trump blamed his Democratic opponent’s supporters for the crime. “Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning,” he said on Twitter. Registered Democrats far outnumber Republicans in Orange County, according to elections board data.  Republicans said the incident took them by surprise but left them undeterred as they started clean-up efforts at their strip-mall headquarters and worked in a bus being used as a temporary mobile office.  “We’re not going to be intimated; we’re not going to be cowed,” Woodhouse said.  On Monday, the Arizona Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix was evacuated for about two hours after a bomb threat was left by phone. Police said nothing was found during a search of the premises.  Party officials said the call was received from an adult male at about 3:15 p.m. local time saying there was a bomb in the building and for occupants to get out.",politicsNews,"October 17, 2016 ",1
5471,GOP Convention In CHAOS: Party Bosses Admit They’re Running Out Of Cash As Trump Scares Sponsors,"The Republican Convention in Cleveland is facing a financial shortfall, and senior party officials are begging for dollars while nominee Donald Trump continues to claim that he is worth at least $10 billion.Politico reports that the party needs money to cover the bills for the event because sponsors they were relying on have pulled out as a result of Donald Trump s bigoted comments and policies.Millions of dollars short and running out of time, organizers of the Republican National Convention have written an urgent request for $6 million to Las Vegas billionaire couple Sheldon and Miriam Adelson to cover the bills for next week s festivities.In a letter addressed to the Adelsons, obtained by POLITICO, the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee revealed the names of more than two dozen prominent corporations and individuals who have reneged on a collective $8.1 million in pledged donations.The letter notes: Over the past couple months, negative publicity around our potential nominee resulted in a considerable number of pledges backing out from their commitments. Politico reports that among those who have backed out of the convention are:David Koch ($1 million), FedEx ($500,000), Visa ($100,000) and both Pepsi ($500,000) and Coca-Cola ($1 million).What isn t explained is why the RNC is hitting up casino billionaire Adelson for this money, when according to his claims about his net worth, $6 million should be no problem for Donald Trump. The incident again raises the question of whether Trump is telling the truth about his net worth or not. He refuses to release his tax returns, so no independent assessment of his wealth is available, though he has previously testified to being far less wealthy than his current $10 billion claim.The funding shortfall is just the latest headache to hit the Republican convention. Concerns are growing about safety, as Ohio is an open-carry state and many pro-Trump protesters have said they plan to carry their guns in response to planned protests from progressive groups.Also, party chairman Reince Priebus and Trump campaign boss Paul Manafort have had to head off efforts by so-called  Never Trump  delegates who could turn the nomination process into an embarrassing television spectacle if they vote against the nominee.Featured image via Flickr",News,"July 14, 2016",0
18770,EU's Verhofstadt pokes fun at British PM May but says a Brexit deal can be done,"The lead Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament poked fun at British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday, quipping that she gave her Brexit speech in Florence because she was familiar with the city s 15th century politics of betrayal. In a speech to students at the London School of Economics, Guy Verhofstadt said Brexit was negative and a waste of time and energy, though he also said Britain s decision to leave the bloc was a failure for the European Union.  I think she chose Florence because Florentine politics in the 15th century made her feel at home,  Verhofstadt said with a smile.  Backstabbing, betrayal, noble families fighting for power... It is an environment that she recognized fairly well.  He said the one positive outcome of Brexit was that the mood in the EU had reversed since Britain s vote to leave in June 2016 and that now many EU citizens did not want to destroy the Union. After May formally notified the EU in March of Britain s intention to leave the EU, the two sides have about a year left to negotiate the terms of the divorce and the outlines of the future relationship before it is due to leave in March 2019.  Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world s biggest trading bloc and the fifth largest global economy, though some chief executives and diplomats fear what they term a disorderly Brexit without a deal. May had hoped that a speech she made in Florence on Friday would unblock the three-month-old talks and pave the way for the EU to open discussions on a post-Brexit free trade deal.  The EU and Britain made progress in the latest round of divorce talks, but not enough to move to the next phase of discussions on a transition period after Brexit or a future trade deal, top negotiators said on Thursday. When Verhofstadt was asked whether he thought a deal could ultimately be done on Brexit, he said:  That s the assumption that I have and it is towards that that we work.   And that a withdrawal agreement be done in March 2019 means that there has to be an agreement in fact in October or November because then the agreement will go to the European Parliament and we need four or five months,  he said.  After what he termed the  failure  of Brexit, Verhofstadt said the EU needed a major overhaul to give the euro zone a government with its own fiscal capacity and its own treasury and finance minister.  We need a management or government of this euro zone with a fiscal capacity, that is in my view the most important. And with a fiscal capacity, normally, you can also give out loans,  he said, adding that some type of euro securities could be issued at some point in the future.",worldnews,"September 28, 2017 ",0
16663,‘PAY TO STAY’: Feds Open Fake University To Catch Fake Visa Scam [Video],"This is such a huge opportunity and the feds probably just scratched the surface.The current state of some American institutions of higher learning, flush with debates about trigger warnings, sexual assault and affirmative action, have left some critics wondering whether college students have time to learn anything anymore. But on the campus of the University of Northern New Jersey (UNNJ), nestled in idyllic Cranford about 20 miles from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, no students were concerned with such matters   because the school, as authorities just announced, was an elaborate front used by undercover federal agents to trap people illegally trying to score fake visas for foreign nationals.Now, the UNNJ sting is over, but leaves quite a wake: the indictments of 21  brokers, recruiters, and employers from across the United States who allegedly conspired with more than 1,000 foreign nationals,  as the Department of Justice explained, to keep them in the country under the auspices of an ersatz alma mater. Some who purchased fake papers ended up working at Facebook or working for the U.S. military, as ABC reported. Pay to Stay  schemes not only damage our perception of legitimate student and foreign worker visa programs, they also pose a very real threat to national security,  New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman said in a statement.

21558,FAMILY THREATENED AT GUNPOINT FOR DISPLAYING CONFEDERATE FLAG ON PRIVATE PROPERTY…Police Let Suspect Go [Video],"Nothing says tolerance like putting a loaded gun to a strangers head because you disagree with the flag they re holding A family was threatened at gunpoint for waving the Confederate flag on their own private property in another illustration of how controversy surrounding the flag is only driving more animosity.The incident occurred on Monday night in Moseley, Virginia while the family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family and started yelling. He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn t worth anything now,  Mark Wilson told CBS 6.  He got out of the car and took three steps towards me and the gun was maybe six inches off my head. Wilson said he was concerned that the gunman would shoot his children. 46-year-old James Baker was later arrested by police for brandishing a weapon. Baker dubiously claimed that the family had threatened his life. This is a busy highway and he is in a vehicle going 70 miles per hour, how are we threatening him by walking across?  said Wilson, who called for Baker to be sent to jail. The police went and investigated it and they let him go, he admitted everything and they just let him go,  added Wilson.Baker is in court on September 3 facing a class one misdemeanor charge.Wilson asserted that his decision to fly the flag is founded on a desire to express pride in his southern heritage and has nothing to do with racism. I m not gonna be scared away from people that are acting ignorant and trying to act violent when it s not a violent thing. This shouldn t be a race thing, it should be a heritage thing,  Wilson told NBC 12.The nature of the confrontation clearly illustrates how the gunman had a political gripe with the family displaying the Confederate flag, which has become a target for irate leftists in the aftermath of the Charleston shooting.On Monday we reported on the new viral Twitter craze called #NoFlaggingChallenge which Black Lives Matter supporters are using to encourage Americans to violate people s private property rights and steal Confederate flags being displayed on privately owned homes and vehicles.Given that the flags are predominantly displayed in southern states where private ownership of firearms is common, many on social media are warning that the stunt could end up with people being shot dead.Via: Infowars",left-news,"Jul 16, 2015",1
12577,BREAKING: DEVICE THAT BUSTED HILLARY CLINTON Discovered To Have Tens Of Thousands Of Emails,"Here s why Clinton and Abedin should be flipping out: Multiple State employees  told the FBI that they considered emailing Abedin  the equivalent of e-mailing Clinton.  Another close Clinton aide told the FBI that  Abedin may have kept emails that Clinton did not. The electronic device shared by Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin and husband Anthony Weiner on which the FBI found more Clinton emails was a laptop and it contained tens-of-thousands of emails, a senior law enforcement official told Fox News on Saturday.The FBI announced Friday that it had restarted an investigation into emails Clinton sent on a private server system while secretary of state, as a result of a probe into Abedin s husband, disgraced New York Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner,  sexting,  of sending sexually-suggestive electronic messages, to a teenage girl.The law enforcement official told Fox News that the laptop had  five digits  of emails, meaning tens-of-thousands of them. However, federal investigators remain unclear whether Abedin or Weiner own the laptop.The FBI conducted a roughly two-year investigation into Clinton s use of a private server system, finding several emails marked as classified and concluded that she had been  extremely careless.  However, the agency did not find evidence that Clinton had been criminally negligent and did not recommend criminal charges to the Justice Department.People familiar with the case say it was restarted by the FBI because the agency thought the new emails were  pertinent to the investigation. The source also told Fox News that law enforcement officials think it s highly unlikely that all of the new-found emails are duplicates, as the Clinton campaign has suggested.Read more: FOX News",politics,"Oct 29, 2016",0
3448,Incoming Trump Deputy Sec. Of State Blames Russian Hacking On Obama ‘False Flag’ (VIDEO),"If you ve ever wondered if Donald Trump is completely unqualified to make any decisions about anything involving the good of our nation, ever, look no further than incoming Deputy Secretary of State John Bolton (who fills in the  Crazed Conspiracy Theorist  box on your Apocalypse BINGO cards, if you re playing). On Sunday, Bolton appeared on Fox News to let the world know to ignore the CIA s evidence that Russia actively worked to install The Donald in the Oval Office because it s all big gubmint propaganda or something  a  false flag operation,  to be exact.Yes, this is a term that we have heard applied to the Sandy Hook shooting and pretty much anything that places conservatives in the uncomfortable position of having to self-analyze their horrific positions on guns, race, gender, and other topics. The phrase was largely made popular by Trump ally Alex Jones and deceased right-wing propagandist Andrew Breitbart (Yeah, the guy conservatives think Obama had killed for knowing too much. They ve even combined this conspiracy theory with the one about Hillary Clinton having child sex slaves in some circles. But I digress) and usually virtually assures that the person who uttered the term is a f*cking idiot.Which, of course, brings us to Bolton. It s not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC computers was not a false flag operation  are words actually uttered by someone Trump just placed in a very important position. Talking Points Memo provided a pretty handy transcript of what went down:BOLTON: It s not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC computers was not a false flag operation. Let s remember what FBI director James Comey said dealing with Hillary s home brew server. He said we found no direct evidence of foreign intelligence service penetration, but given the nature of this, we didn t expect to. Meaning, a really sophisticated foreign intelligence service would not leave any cyber fingerprints. And yet people say they did leave cyber fingerprints in the hacks regarding our election. So the question that has to be asked is why did the Russians run their smart intelligence service against Hillary s server but their dumb intelligence services against the election  SHAWN: When you say false flag, that s a very serious charge. False flag by whom? Here is  The Washington post.  The Post reported the CIA has concluded individuals with close ties to the Russian government hacked the e-mails. Intelligence officials have determined that Russia s goal was to help trump win rather than simply undermine confidence in the election. Are you actually accusing someone here in this administration of trying   in the intelligence community of trying to throw something?BOLTON: We just don t know, but I believe that intelligence has been politicized in the Obama administration to a very significant degree.SHAWN: Would the intelligence officials politicize this to go so far that could damage our republic and what we have for 200-plus years stood for.BOLTON: I think the whole thing is called into question and an independent investigation becomes extremely important. I think it s critical to answer the question I posed. If you think the Russians did this, then why did they leave fingerprints?SHAWN: Maybe because we have such sophisticated and  BOLTON: James Comey and the FBI couldn t find any fingerprints  SHAWN: They use a different standard. It s been shown they have a criminal start by the CIA has more of an intellectual  BOLTON: Let s hear the debate.SHAWN: What do you want to hear? Something from the CIA director?BOLTON: I d like to know. I think we have something now. We don t want to compromise intelligence sources and methods but when you make that kind of allegation, if it were true, and the Russians have the capability and the intention of doing it, I m not by any means trying to exonerate them, but if you say they ve done that, let me be clear, either in the cyber world or elsewhere, we should retaliate. It is unacceptable for the American constitution to be assaulted by foreigners in that way. So it is absolutely critical as well that we get the facts right on this, and I don t think we have anywhere enough in the public domain to know what the facts are.SHAWN: The president has ordered a review. Senator McCain and others of the Armed Services Committee are having hearings on this with the new congress. Let me read you a statement from both Senators McCain, SenatorsGraham, Schumer, and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, both bipartisan. For years foreign adversaries have directed cyber attacks at America s physical, economic, and military infrastructure while stealing our intellectual property. Now our institutions have been targeted. Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American. This cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country. McCain this morning called Putin a thug, a killer, and a murderer. The president has ordered a public review. What are you calling on the president to do before January 20th? To reveal the classified information? To bring it all out so Americans can know if Russia had a hand in this election?BOLTON: One thing that makes me very nervous is Barack Obama saying let s have this report before the 20th of January so I can wrap it up. I think the burden for well or ill is going to fall on Mike Pompeo who has been named as president-elect trump s cia director. I think he s trusted by republicans and democrats. He doesn t bring any baggage. He s a new official at the CIA. I d look to him to head up an investigation across the entire intelligence committee. I just think these are such serious charges, again, if the Russians or any other foreign government think that they can undermine the integrity of our elections or defeat our constitutional process, this is just as serious an attack as a military attack.SHAWN: For those who are bothered by your claim of a potential false flag, that s very disturbing as an American.BOLTON: We would want to know who else might want to influence the election and why they would leave fingerprints that point to the Russians. That s why I say until we know more about how the insurance   intelligence community came to this conclusion  While he didn t say definitively that he believed this to be a  false flag,  Bolton made it clear that he might-or-might-not believe that President Obama   whose administration has a history of politicizing intelligence  to a very significant degree,  wink, wink   might or might not have told the CIA to falsely claim that Russia helped Donald Trump get elected because reasons. Makes perfect sense.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"December 12, 2016",1
5142,"No, Tom Cotton, Hillary Clinton’s Emails Did NOT Get An Iranian Scientist Executed (VIDEO)","On Sunday, Iran executed a nuclear scientist for  giving vital information to the enemy. Shahram Amiri disappeared in 2009 during a trip to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. For a year he was missing, but then resurfaced in the United States in June of 2010. Amiri says that he had been kidnapped by the CIA and put under intense psychological pressure to reveal sensitive information.  He claims that he rejected the United States  efforts to break him, but the U.S. Government said at the time that Amiri had defected voluntarily, and had been paid millions of dollars for  useful information  related to the country s nuclear program.The next month, he appeared in Washington DC at the Iranian interests section of Pakistan s embassy, seeking to return to Iran.Days later, he obtained passage home, where he originally received a hero s welcome. But in May of 2011, he was arrested and tried for treason. Though his family believed he had been given ten years in prison, which would have made him eligible for release in 2022, he was actually sentenced to death. Finally, his execution was carried out on August 7, 2016. Amiri had access to confidential military secrets and was connected to our No. 1 enemy, the Great Satan,  Islamic Republic of Iran spokesman Gholamhosein Mohseni-Ejei said in his weekly news conference.  He was sentenced to death in primary court, and the sentence was confirmed by Supreme Court  after Amiri appealed the decision. The CIA thought that its movements were kept away from the eye of Iranian Intelligence Ministry,  Mohseni-Ejei said.  They took Amiri to Saudi Arabia. To most, this seems fairly standard. He released video informing his country that he betrayed their national secrets to the CIA, the United States confirmed that he had done so, and for some reason he thought it was safe to return home. This is documented history   unless, of course, you re Tom Cotton.You see, Amiri was mentioned in recently-released Clinton emails. According to Cotton, the messages, which did not become public until very recently, were the cause of Amiri s 2011 arrest and death sentence. We have a diplomatic,  psychological  issue, not a legal one. Our friend has to be given a way out,  Richard Morningstar, a former State Department special envoy for Eurasian energy, wrote nine days before he returned to Iran.  Our person won t be able to do anything anyway. If he has to leave so be it.  On  Face the Nation,  Cotton tossed a thick layer of blame on Clinton: I m not going to comment on what he may or may not have done for the United States government, but in the emails that were on Hillary Clinton s private server, there were conversations among her senior advisors about this gentleman. That goes to show just how reckless and careless her decision was to put that kind of highly classified information on a private server. And I think her judgment is not suited to keep this country safe,  Cotton added, apparently forgetting that all of this happened years before her emails were released.In fact, the timing doesn t seem to matter to anyone on the right wing. Gateway Pundit s Jim Hoft, more commonly known as the  stupidest man on the internet  (seriously, Google it), declared that Clinton s  unprotected  emails  got [an] Iranian nuclear scientist executed. They found out he was working for the US thanks to Hillary Clinton s emails,  Hoft writes.  Nice work, Hillary.  He even includes this cute little tweet: Unfortunately for all of them, a quick Google search quickly disproves their latest stupid, stupid theory related to Hillary s emails.F*ck off, Tom and Jim.Watch Cotton try to blame Hillary below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"August 7, 2016",1
2468,Trump urged Washington to stop bank mergers in 2004 letter,"President Donald Trump warned the administration of George W. Bush in 2004 that big U.S. bank mergers were “totally out of control” and should be stopped as they were forcing businesses to borrow money from foreigners, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Though it is 13 years old, the unsolicited letter from Trump, when he was a New York real estate developer and businessman, to then-Treasury Secretary John Snow sheds some light on Trump’s attitudes toward big banks, which he has alternately lambasted and embraced since becoming a politician. As recently as May, Trump said he was looking at breaking up big banks, echoing a campaign theme from 2016. But as president, Trump has also promised to roll back bank regulations, and he has hired Goldman Sachs veterans as close advisers. In the February 2004 letter to Snow, Trump urged the Bush administration to block a historic merger between Wall Street giants JPMorgan Chase and Bank One. Unveiled a month before Trump wrote to Snow, the deal was completed in July 2004. Trump also asked Snow to stop a merger then under way between Bank of America and FleetBoston Financial. It was completed in April 2004, a few months after the Trump letter, which Reuters obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request and which has not been previously reported. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The letter shows that as a businessman and a reality TV celebrity, Trump was worried about bank combinations and businesses relying on foreign lenders. “Hopefully, you can do something about this very serious situation - which has gotten totally out of control,” Trump wrote. “If this present trend continues, there will literally be one bank left in New York and, perhaps, the country.” “This merger activity has made it almost impossible to deal with these institutions ... and is pushing a tremendous amount of business to foreign banks and lenders,” he wrote. A financial disclosure statement released last month showed that Trump owed at least $130 million to a U.S. unit of Germany’s Deutsche Bank, a sizable share of his total debts of at least $315 million as of mid-2017. Trump has not released his complete income tax returns, which would give a clearer view of his debts to foreign lenders. Amid a public debate on whether the president could be influenced by his debts to foreigners, Trump’s lawyers said in May he does not owe money to Russian lenders. JPMorgan and Bank of America declined to comment. Snow also declined to comment. The United States had about 9,000 federally insured banks in 2004. That number was down by about half from 1984, due in part to aggressive buyout activity. By 2017, the number of U.S. banks was down further, to about 6,000, while the share of assets managed by smaller community banks had fallen to 13 percent from 38 percent in 1984.        Before becoming president, Trump had a contentious relationship with commercial banks after a slump in his casino business. In 1990 he owed a combined $4 billion to scores of banks, according to a lawyer whose team led negotiations between Trump and 72 banks to restructure Trump’s loans.  The Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991 and some of Trump’s lenders vowed never to work with him again after failing to recover 100 percent of what they were owed.  But by 2004, Trump was back on the upswing. His television show “The Apprentice” premiered the month before he sent the letter to Snow. In a hand-written postscript to the letter, Trump wrote: “P.S. I MET YOUR SON IN FLORIDA - HE IS GREAT.”",politicsNews,"July 27, 2017 ",0

5337,Traumatized Indiana Mom ‘Terrified’ After Becoming Target Of White Supremacists (VIDEO),"Mia Frias-Russell, an African American mother of three, recently moved from Indianapolis, Indiana to the smaller town of Campbellsburg, nearly 600 miles away. According to City Data, the town has a population of less than 600 people and 97.4 percent of the residents are white.Ms. Russell says she has experienced various forms of racial discrimination since moving to the small Indiana town. During an interview with WTHR, she said people yell racial slurs at her while she s outside working in the yard.On July 20, the situation escalated. Ms. Russell stepped outside her Campbellsburg home that morning to find racial slurs sprayed all over her house. The words  N*gg*r go,  and  N*gg*r b*tch  were among the messages left for the mother and her three children. Her car was also painted with racial slurs. Authorities also believe that the vandals put sugar in the vehicle s gas tank.The terrified mom recorded a video of the aftermath, which she then uploaded to Facebook.  I m scared,  she said through her tears,  I don t know who could have done this.  Ms. Russell went on to say that the day before someone tried to run her car off the road.Watch the video below via YouTube:According to WTHR, Ms. Russell is renting her home in Campbellsburg. She is now trying to get out of her lease because she does not feel safe living in the area. She described the incident as both  traumatizing  and  terrifying. Authorities say they are looking for the people responsible for vandalizing Ms. Russell s home. According to ISP Sgt. Jerry Goodin those responsible will be charged with criminal mischief. The police may also upgrade the charges using the state s bias crime statute. Indiana s bias crime statute is similar to hate crimes statutes used to enhance criminal charges in other parts of the United States.It s unimaginable that, in the year 2016, this young mother does not feel safe driving down the street or even falling asleep in her own home. This is terrorism and those who were involved should be prosecuted as terrorists, not as vandals or petty criminals.Image credit; video screen capture via Mia Frias-Russell on Facebook",News,"July 24, 2016",0

3820,Megyn Kelly Makes BOMBSHELL Admission About Trump And The Media,"Before the leaked tape of Donald Trump describing his propensity to grab women  by the pussy  to Billy Bush, it seemed that the media was ignoring Donald Trump s glaring faults as a presidential candidate. During the primaries, for example, he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors. It turns out there might be a reason for that   Trump was bribing the media   at least that s the accusation being made by Megyn Kelly of Fox News.In her memoire  Settle for More,  which will be released this week, Kelly said that Trump likely received the infamous question, in which she asked about the fact that he has called women  fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.  That question set Trump off on one of his Twitter tirades. These are only a portion:The worst and most controversial of which was this:As the election progressed, it became more and more apparent that Trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior, he expected, no, demanded that the media kiss his orange ass. If they didn t, he would cut off access, but before that, he tried bribery.While Kelly couldn t speak for other members of the media, she alleges that Trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels, with full perks. While the attempt clearly didn t work on Kelly, she says that with some, their loyalty came cheap, or perhaps not so cheap. This is actually one of the untold stories of the 2016 campaign: I was not the only journalist to whom Trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage,  Kelly said. He also attempted to woo them with praise, she said, adding,  This is smart, because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking. Trump tried to work the refs, and some of the refs responded,  she said.When it became obvious that some reporters were  in the tank  for Trump, she alleges in one chapter,  certain TV hosts  would work with the candidate in advance on occasional Trump criticism so they would appear unbiased. She didn t identify them by name or media outlet.Source: YahooKelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which Kelly asked about Trump s treatment of women, the candidate called Fox News exec. Bill Sammon, who told him about the first question. All we heard about, though, during the election, was that it was Hillary Clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering. The insider knowledge said that a woman, in the Flint, Michigan debate, would ask a question about the Flint water.While bribing journalists isn t illegal, per say, it is highly unethical. Without the Fourth Estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics, democracy is impossible.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 13, 2016",1
7013,Rick Scott Was So Butthurt By The Woman Who Called Him An A-Hole He Released This Attack Ad (VIDEO),"Florida Governor Rick Scott isn t up for re-election. His creepy, Skeletor-like appearance is secured through 2018. His flip-flopping political ideologies, war on women s health care and ridiculous rules forbidding state workers from so much as saying the words  climate change  aren t going anywhere. His refusal to expand Medicaid because his own state s failures serve as some kind of an imaginary warning sign is set in stone.Why, then, did the most powerful man in the Sunshine State feel it necessary to have a YouTube ad produced attacking the woman who recently called him out for being an a**hole? Because he is an a**hole, why else? Poor Ricky decided to go the route of butthurt little toddler who was scolded by his mother in public, causing him to hold his breath until someone made it right.His PAC obliged, of course, most likely fearful that he would don his Grim Reaper outfit and send them to the depths of hell with a touch from his evil sickle.  Let s Get Working produced a one-minute video, naming the woman the  Latte Liberal  and attacking her for  sitting around coffee shops complaining and demanding public assistance.  In case you haven t seen the interaction between them, enjoy. Crypt-Keeper Scott could only stand there and take credit for the economy recovering from a recession his state s housing market bubble helped create with that disturbing smile on his face that is rumored to consume the souls of small children and fluffy kittens:Scott answers her criticism with  We ve a million new jobs.  Yes, that s true. Unfortunately, far too many of those jobs will serve to lift unemployed people up and dump them into the  Medicaid gap  of income between qualifying for Medicaid and subsidies for the Health Care Marketplace. Scott didn t have anything to say about the signing of archaic abortion laws and deep budget cuts to any clinic that provides any abortion services, including Planned Parenthood.That video has gone viral, with more than 2 million views, and for poor little Ricky, that just couldn t stand. He felt the need to release this attack on a woman who clearly had the interests of the average person in mind when she gave him a piece of her mind:The answer to criticism from a Republican Governor is about as stereotypical as can be nowadays: The ad s narrator calls her names and dumps rhetoric about how many jobs have been created in a state whose economic growth and unemployment numbers basically mirror that of the rest of the country.Then they find it more appealing to attack her political views rather than address the issue of healthcare. Because all those people who want silly things like affordable ways to see a doctor are just lazy whiners looking for public assistance.Rick Scott, as usual, is completely disconnected from the reality of the people he  serves.

13906,"North Korea's wounded defector 'nice guy,' likes CSI: surgeon","North Korea s latest defector, a young soldier known only by his family name Oh, is a quiet, pleasant man who has nightmares about being returned to the North, his surgeon said on Thursday.  He s a pretty nice guy,  said lead surgeon John Cook-Jong Lee, who has been operating and caring for the 24-year-old. Oh has become a focus of worldwide attention after he was badly wounded by fellow North Korean soldiers as he scrambled across the border in the Demilitarized Zone that separates North and South on Nov. 13. Video of Oh s escape released on Wednesday showed him stumbling over the border and being dragged unconscious through the undergrowth by South Korean troops. Surgeon Lee has been almost the only person to speak with Oh since he arrived at the hospital, he told Reuters in an interview at his office at Ajou University Hospital, just a few floors away from where the defector lies guarded by South Korean special forces and intelligence officers. The surgeon, who has hung a South Korean flag in the soldier s room, said he is avoiding subjects that may disturb his patient. Oh is eating his first  clear liquid  food such as broths, and can smile, talk, and use his hands, Lee said. But when his patient woke on Sunday he cried out in pain, and Lee said he is still anxious about the South Korean guards. Lee said Oh told him that he had joined the North Korean army when he was 17, right after secondary school graduation. The soldier s hair is styled  like a jarhead, like a U.S. Marine, so I actually joked  why don t you join the South Korean Marines?  He smiled and said that he would never ever go back to the military system again.  Medical teams have worked for days to remove the shards of at least four bullets from Oh s body, stitch up his shredded organs, and treat pre-existing conditions including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and a case of massive intestinal worms, Lee said.  He s a quite strong man,  said Lee.  Since Oh s defection, North Korea appeared to have replaced all its security guards on the border, an intelligence source in the South told Yonhap news agency on Thursday.  Lee said that when the defector arrived in an American military helicopter at the hospital   which is equipped with state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment and is used to treat VIP visitors such as visiting U.S. presidents - he came with zero personal information. On the flight in, American army flight medics had fought to keep Oh alive, jabbing a large needle into his chest to treat a collapsed lung.   Oh was immediately wheeled into a diagnostic room where doctors confirmed he was suffering from massive internal bleeding.  We knew then that we didn t have time to hesitate,  Lee said, standing in that room Thursday night. Two major surgeries were required to remove the bullets and patch Oh back together, and the medical team pumped as much as 12 liters of new blood into his body. The normal body has less than half as much blood.  He told me that he is so thankful for South Koreans for saving his life and giving him that much blood,  Lee said. Lee has been playing South Korean pop music and American films and TV shows for his patient, but has not exposed him to any news coverage. Among the shows, Oh showed a liking for the French-American thriller  Transporter 3,  comedy  Bruce Almighty  starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman; and the crime-solving TV series  CSI,  Lee said. Most North Korean defectors undergo security questioning by South Korea s intelligence agency once they arrive in the South before being sent to a resettlement center for a three-month education on life in the South. After they are released, central and local governments provide 7 million won ($6,450) in cash over a year, as well as support in housing, education and job training. Police officers are assigned to each of the defectors to ensure their security and safety. Even if Oh fully recovers, some scars will stay for the rest of his life, the surgeon said.  Among the longest lasting wounds will be the damage to his colon, which was shredded by a bullet and had to be stitched back together in seven places.  It s a lifelong complication for the patient, so he s better to be very cautious in his diet,  said the surgeon. Besides the potential for further medical complications, Lee says he is most worried about making sure Oh recovers psychologically. The soldier has already told him he had a nightmare about being returned to the North.  The surgeon said he has asked senior South Korean military officials who are eager to question the soldier to hold off  while he recovers.  This North Korean guy is not going anywhere,  Lee said.  He is staying in South Korea. So we don t need to be hasty.",worldnews,"November 23, 2017 ",0
928,New Poll: WAY More Americans Want Trump Impeached Than Approve Of The Job He Is Doing,"Donald Trump has been notorious for touting poll numbers that look good for him. During the campaign, whenever he d careen into one of his many controversies and the numbers dipped, he and his mouthpieces would reference junk polls to show that people still loved The Donald. Of course, any poll that can be voted in a million times online is bogus. However, factual data isn t bogus, and that data does not look good for Trump right now. In fact, a new poll shows that way more Americans want Trump removed from office than the number of people who think he s doing a good job.According to new data from Public Policy Polling, 47 percent of Americans see Donald Trump as the incompetent, dangerously unstable buffoon he is, and want him impeached posthaste. On the other hand, just 37 percent believe he is actually a good president. That isn t surprising; after all, the slavish, blind devotion of his mouthbreathing base has not been a secret for nigh on two years now.On the other side of said insane base, there were marches around the nation for the holiday weekend demanding Trump s removal and protesting his administration and their policies. Further, more Democrats are becoming emboldened by these numbers and are actually drafting articles of impeachment. One such Democrat is Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA). Speaking in his home district in Los Angeles, Rep. Sherman egged the anti-Trump crowd on, saying: We have to act now to protect our country from abuse of power and impulsive, ignorant incompetence. At this declaration, the crowd borrowed from Trump s own base, and shouted back:  LOCK HIM UP! Of course, there s one little difference between Trump s base and the Democrats   there s PLENTY of evidence to suggest that Trump is a criminal, while there is absolutely none to suggest the same about Hillary Clinton.Of course, there will be no impeachment until the Democrats take back the House of Representatives, and there will be no invocation of the 25th Amendment to remove and unfit  president  from office for the sake of the nation. Therefore, we MUST turn out in 2018, and make sure we control both chambers of Congress. That s the only way we get real, credible Congressional investigations into the Russia ordeal, and it s the only way we get rid of Trump and his criminal administration.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"July 5, 2017",0

We ve known for more than a year she deleted 30,000 emails her attorneys deemed  personal business,  which many speculate included information about the relationship between her official office and the Clinton Foundation.Last month, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange promised to release additional and damning information surrounding Clinton s personal email use and said the Democrat presidential candidate should be  worried  about what s coming.

We have a perfect ten year record so far in never gets it wrong and we want to keep that reputation, understand how things should be formatted, what media we should be involved in, what is the best way to stage it out? Do we accumulate everything and essentially publish all in one batch or do we smaller batches?

1006,GOP Senator Lashes Into Kellyanne Conway Over Trumpcare Lies And It Is Epic (VIDEO),"Despite how much the mainstream media and America has clearly communicated that no one is interested in what Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway has to say anymore, she unfortunately keeps finding ways to spread her alternative facts. Recently, Conway was caught lying about the American Health Care Act, the disastrous replacement to Obamacare   and even the GOP is pissed about it.According to Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Conway needs to shut up and sit down when it comes to the recently unveiled Republican health care bill. In an interview with CNN host Jim Scuitto, Cassidy trashed Conway for trying to speak for the Republican Party as a whole, and made it clear that she was merely the spokeswoman for Donald Trump, not the GOP. Scuitto asked Cassidy about Conway s recent false statements: Over the weekend, Kellyanne Conway, spokesperson and surrogate for the White House, made a remarkable claim that there aren t any Medicaid cuts in this bill. Is the GOP misleading Americans about what s actually in this bill? Cassidy s response could not have been any more fed up with Conway. Cassidy bluntly said: Kellyanne Conway is not the GOP. However, Scuitto argued that  She s a very close spokesperson for the president and speaks for the president. Cassidy just shook his head and said,  I just can t address that , signaling that yet another Republican is ashamed beyond belief over Trump and his incompetent, dishonest team.You can watch the interview below:Conway had blatantly lied about there being no Medicaid cuts in the GOP s new health care plan   there are actually substantial cuts being made to the program and they are being widely reported, particularly after the CBO has weighed in.Conway s lies yet again prove that she cannot be trusted, even after having previously banned from all reputable cable news shows.

I want to continue to be a Republican because it annoys them,  Powell quipped to host Walter Isaacson. I think the party has shifted much further right than where the country is and it should be obvious to party leaders that they cannot keep saying and doing the things that they were doing and hope to be successful in national-level election in the future, not just in 2016,  he added.Powell said a small faction in the GOP is alienating voters with their rhetoric on immigration. I think most Republicans understand that we need immigration, we are an immigrant nation [and that] it is in our best interest to do it,  he said. But there are pockets of intolerance within the Republican Party [and] the Republican Party had better figure out how to defeat that. Via: The Hill",politics,"Oct 1, 2015",1
7223,"Schumer, McConnell elected top leaders in Senate","Democratic U.S. senators elected Chuck Schumer of New York as minority leader on Wednesday, and he tapped former presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders to help Democrats woo blue-collar workers, many of whom voted for President-elect Donald Trump. Senate Republicans also met and voted to keep Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as the majority leader. Schumer, 65, replaces the retiring Harry Reid of Nevada as the top Democrat in the Senate as the party prepares to deal with Republican Trump and Republican majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives. Schumer said Democrats had learned from the Nov. 8 election that they needed “a sharper, bolder economic message about returning the economic system which so many feel is rigged against them to one that works for the people.” “We’re ready to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Republicans, working with soon-to-be-President Trump on issues where we agree, but we will go toe-to-toe against the president-elect whenever our values or the progress we’ve made is under assault,” Schumer, who has been in the Senate since 1999, told reporters after the Democrats’ closed-door election. In a move recognizing the influence of Sanders with many working-class voters, Schumer asked the independent senator from Vermont to be caucus head of outreach. Sanders, who lost the presidential primary to former senator and secretary of state Hillary Clinton, said his job was to reach out to “grassroots America.” Another liberal, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was given the role of vice chair of the conference while yet another progressive voice, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, was made conference secretary. Senator Joe Manchin, a more conservative Democrat from West Virginia, was named vice chairman of the Democratic policy and communications committee.  Schumer said he knew there would be differences of opinion on the new team, but that together the group could “speak to the blue-collar worker in West Virginia, and Michigan, as well as the people who live along the coast.”  Trump’s economic populism helped him flip some once-reliably Democratic areas in blue-collar states while Democrats did better in large urban centers and coastal states. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois remained minority whip, the No. 2 spot, while Senator Patty Murray of Washington was chosen as assistant Democratic leader. In the House, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi announced she was running for minority leader again and said she already has the support of more than two-thirds of her caucus. Pelosi, who may face a challenger, agreed this week to delay leadership elections until Nov. 30 after her fellow Democrats called for more time to reassess why they fell short of their goals in the Nov. 8 election.",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",0

It seems like this may be just the high-profile screw-up the White House has been waiting for in order to revisit the legitimacy of voter rolls in New York.NY refuses to perpetuate the myth voter fraud played a role in our election. We will not comply with this request.https://t.co/eQC6ORV0v1  Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 30, 2017Kushner, President Trump s son-in-law, and senior adviser did in fact list himself as a male in his New York voter registration   but an elections database error led to him getting listed as a female.Kushner s supposed registration as a woman, which made headlines Wednesday, is actually a data entry error that the New York Board of Elections corrected only after it became public.A Wired story first reported that Kushner   whose father-in-law has been waging a fact-challenged war on voter fraud   was registered as a woman on his publicly accessible New York State voter information.   NYDaily NewsThe Wired story that was written by Ashley Feinberg suggests one of the reasons Kushner registered to vote as a female may be attributed to him committing voter fraud, which according to Feinberg,  would, of course, would be interesting, considering that Trump s White House has been fixated on allegations that rampant voter fraud took place during the 2016 election. The Huffington Post used the fake news story to prove that Jared Kushner is not capable of brokering peace in the Middle East. Here is their headline for an article written by Amanda Terkel:From the Huffington Post article:If people weren t already skeptical that Kushner   a man who inherited his father s real estate empire and has no policy experience in the Middle East or elsewhere   could achieve the impossible, recent developments may give further pause.He registered to vote as a woman.Radical leftist and (sometimes) comedian Jimmy Kimmel did an entire skit on Jared Kushner registering to vote as a  female.

21952,NEW YORK KNOWN WOLF: Halloween Truck Attacker Known to DHS Prior to ‘Act of Terror’,"Shawn Helton  21st Century WireYears before allegedly carrying out a truck rampage on Halloween, the man named in New York s most recent  act of terror  was already well-known to the United States Department of Homeland Security. This latest supposedly homegrown  ISIS-inspired  attack produces yet another  known wolf  with ties to suspected terrorists as well as authorities. According to officials, 29 year-old Sayfullo Saipov, the man charged in a deadly Manhattan vehicular assault on October 31st, was previously questioned over suspected ties to terrorism in 2015 by the US Department of Homeland Security. Saipov reportedly became a permanent legal resident upon arriving in the US on a diversity lottery visa in 2010. Since that time, the suspected terrorist moved from Ohio, Florida, and most recently to New Jersey, where he was interviewed by DHS in 2015.As media attention on this case is focused on immigration laws, terror propaganda and security protocols   America s latest terror tragedy reveals much more below the surface   KNOWN WOLF    There s a distinct pattern with acts of terror committed on Western soil. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Another American  Known Wolf Suspected terrorist Sayfullo (Habibullaevic) Saipov, who bounced across America, committed only minor traffic violations before his alleged involvement in the New York truck attack.Over the past 24 hours, the suspected truck attacker Saipov, was said to have driven a Home Depot rental truck from New Jersey to the Manhattan area, where it is believed he deliberately targeted pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path alongside the Hudson River according to police reports. Shortly after the vehicular attack authorities state that Siapov brandished a pellet gun and paintball gun prior to being shot by NYPD and taken into custody. All told, at least eight people were said to have been killed, while nearly a dozen others were injured in the high-profile terror incident.Reports state that Saipov became radicalized in America, allegedly taking ques from ISIS terror propaganda. However, Saipov, originally from Tashkent, the capital city of Uzbekistan, was supposedly from a modest and secular family that did not go to mosques, making this yet another suspicious terror-related case that paints a murky portrait on the way towards extremism.  SUSPECT    The alleged New York truck attacker was apparently a registered driver for popular car services Uber and Lyft. (Image Source: twitter)Rather intriguingly, in a published report at ABC News we re told Saipov, had been the subject of a deeper counter-terror investigation back in 2015: Sayfullo Saipov, who has been charged with killing eight people in a vehicle attack on the West Side of Manhattan on Tuesday, was interviewed in 2015 by federal agents about possible ties to suspected terrorists but a case was never opened against him, law enforcement officials tell ABC News. Continuing, the article outlined the following: Saipov was listed as a  point of contact  for two men who were listed in a Department of Homeland Security counterterrorism database and later overstayed their tourist visas, a federal official told ABC News. One was flagged after arriving from a so-called  threat country,  while the other vanished and was being actively sought by federal agents as a  suspected terrorist. Incredibly, in less than 24 hours after the deadly vehicular assault in New York, FBI authorities have located the suspected terrorist who supposedly vanished from the gaze of authorities said to be linked to Saipov.Today FBI investigators released an alert regarding 32 year-old Mukhammadzoir Kadirov, a person of interest, who authorities also believe is linked to the recent attack.CNN reported the following background information regarding Siapov:In a recently published report from the NY Times, elements of a recent FBI probe into a suspected terror cell charged in Brooklyn over the past two years was revealed: Over the last two years, a terrorism investigation by the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security, the New York Police Department and federal prosecutors in Brooklyn resulted in charges against five men from Uzbekistan and one from Kazakhstan of providing material support to ISIS. Several of the men have pleaded guilty. It is unclear whether Mr. Saipov was connected with that investigation. QUESTION: Will the FBI eventually reveal that Saipov and Kadirov were on their radar prior to the New York truck attack? Only time will tell This latest act of terror in America may well prove to be similar in scope to many other  known wolf  cases in recent history, as readers might recall the alleged New York bombing suspect 28 year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami, had been known to the FBI for years prior to supposedly carrying out plots in New York and New Jersey in the fall of 2016.According to The Washington Post, the FBI had already known Rahami since 2014, which only added to the strongly suspicious event: The FBI s probe into Ahmad Khan Rahami, the 28-year-old named as the only suspect in the bombings, was launched based on comments his father had made. An official said his father later recanted his comments. Agents conducted interviews, checked with other agencies and looked at internal databases,  none of which revealed ties to terrorism,  the bureau said in a statement.   DARK DAYS    The crime scene of the recent New York truck attack. (Image Source: twitter)HAND IN HAND: Terror & Security QUESTION: Is it possible the FBI or any intelligence agency played some part in the latest New York City attack plot   whether inadvertently or otherwise?In the search for answers regarding the investigative tactics of various intelligence agencies that have come into question, there s none perhaps more dubious than the FBI s Newburgh sting operation that resulted in the entrapment four men who participated in a fabricated event created by the bureau.Here s a 2011 passage from The Guardian describing how a FBI informant named Shahed Hussain coerced four others into a fake terror plot: The  Newburgh Four  now languish in jail. Hussain does not. For Hussain was a fake. In fact, Hussain worked for the FBI as an informant trawling mosques in hope of picking up radicals.Yet far from being active militants, the four men he attracted were impoverished individuals struggling with Newburgh s grim epidemic of crack, drug crime and poverty. One had mental issues so severe his apartment contained bottles of his own urine. He also believed Florida was a foreign country.Hussain offered the men huge financial inducements to carry out the plot   including $250,000 to one man   and free holidays and expensive cars.As defence lawyers poured through the evidence, the Newburgh Four came to represent the most extreme form of a controversial FBI policy to use invented terrorist plots to lure targets.  There has been no case as egregious as this. It is unique in the incentive the government provided. A quarter million dollars?  said Professor Karen Greenberg, a terrorism expert at Fordham University. The reputation of the FBI has suffered greatly in the recent past as well as over the past couple of decades. Following the 1993 WTC bombing, the FBI was revealed to have been  handling Emad A. Salem, a former Egyptian army officer who was a prized undercover operative thrust into confidential informant status and person who played a key role in the bomb plot.QUESTION: Will authorities reveal that Siapov may have also had ties to informants or other known wolves?Here at 21WIRE, we ve kept a running report on  known wolf  actors involved in many attacks on Western soil. Take a look below at an updated version that includes other suspicious intelligence informant and terror cases that have held that distinction over the years:Tamerlan Tsarnaev (see his story here) Buford Rogers (see his story here) Jerad Miller (see his story here) Naji Mansour (see his story here) Quazi Mohammad Nafis (see his story here) Mohamed Osman Mohamud (see his story here) Timothy McVeigh (see his story here) Salim Benghalem (see his story here) Michael Adebolajo (see his story here) Daba Deng (see his story here) Elton Simpson (see his story here) Man Haron Monis (see his story here) Abu Hamza (see his story here) Haroon Rashid Aswat (see his story here) Mark Vicars (see his story here) Glen Rodgers (see his story here) Omar Mateen (see his story here) Tashfeen Malik (see her story here) Djamel Beghal (see his story here) Anjem Choudary (see his story here) Cherif Kouachi (see his story here) Said Kouachi (see his story here) Amedy Coulibaly (see his story here) Hayat Boumeddiene (see her story here) Salah Abdeslam (see his story here) Michael Zehaf-Bibeau (see his story here) Nidal Malik Hassan (see his story here) Abdelhakim Dekhar (see his story here) Abdelhamid Abaaoud (see his story here) Samy Amimour (see his story here) Isma l Omar Mostefa (see his story here) Mohamed Lahouij Bouhlel (see his story here) Anis Amri (see his story here) Esteban Santiago-Ruiz (see his story here) Abdulkadir Masharipov (see his story here) Khalid Masood (see his story here) Khuram Butt (see his story here) Youssef Zaghba (see his story here)Since 9/11, the city of New York has dedicated a massive amount of resources to anti-terror training, with a police department larger than the standing armies of 84 countries. It is a city that has done more than any other American city as far as terror readiness yet, it continues to be plagued by a series of plots and attacks over the last 16 years.Following America s previous most deadly mass shooting in Orlando were reports revealing that the FBI had a close relationship with the suspected attacker through the use of a well-known confidential informant. Similarly, recent reports state that FBI, court filings have revealed how the agency allowed an alleged  home grown  ISIS attack to take place in Garland, Texas.  21WIRE previously uncovered suspicious elements regarding the cartoon event in Garland when the attack occurred.QUESTION: How is it that federal agencies continue to let known wolves slip through the cracks?As we ve stated before, mass media injects their own formula for laying out a familiar series of polarizing political points in the aftermath of any  tragic  event. Appearing to purposefully redirect the public to look at a ready-made laundry list of hateful rhetoric, social media declarations and random writings as an ironclad motive for a crime. The aftermath in the recent terror case of New York is no different, as it has already rapidly descended into a barrage of politically motivated theorizing.The story of a Uzbekistan truck attacker also recalls the the suspicious terror case involving the Turkish nightclub shooting at the start of the year on New Year s Eve.To unravel future cases, it s important to keep a watchful eye on any links to past plots 21WIRE associate editor Shawn Helton is a researcher and writer, specializing in forensic analysis of high-profile crime scene and counter terrorism investigations, and the deconstruction and analysis of the mass-media coverage surrounding those cases.

7231,Top U.S. diplomat role an unlikely fit for 'tough guy' Giuliani,"Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is now the leading candidate to become President-elect Donald Trump’s secretary of state, but even some Republicans say his tough-guy personality and global business ties may be at odds with international diplomacy. Giuliani, 72, has been one of Trump’s most vocal and high-profile supporters, and according to sources close to him and Trump, he is eager to become the top U.S. diplomat and expects a decision by Trump as early as next week. The other top candidate, the sources said, is former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, a foreign policy hawk. New York mayor at the time of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by al Qaeda militants, Giuliani is also considered a hard-liner on national security matters, but he has little diplomatic experience. Still, some prominent Republicans said he is qualified to take command of U.S. diplomacy at a time of chaos in the Middle East, rising nationalism in much of Europe, and growing challenges from Russia and China. Senator Lindsey Graham, a respected conservative voice on defense and foreign policy who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee and who made a rather short-lived bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, on Tuesday called Giuliani “competent and capable” of being secretary of state.  “Rudy is an internationally-known figure. He’s a personal friend. He has dealt with the unimaginable, which was 9/11. He’s a loyal supporter of President Trump. He should be rewarded in my view,” Graham told reporters. Giuliani himself extolled his foreign policy credentials in an interview with Fox News Channel’s Sean Hannity on Tuesday.  “I’ve been in 80 countries, 150 different foreign trips,” Giuliani said. “A lot of it for different reasons. Speeches. Security consulting, where I helped bring down crime.” Critics, however, said they are troubled not only by Giuliani’s combative nature and lack of experience, but also by his international business ties and his lucrative speaking engagements for an Iranian exile group that was on the U.S. terrorism list until four years ago. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its consideration of Giuliani for secretary of state. After serving as New York mayor for eight years, Giuliani founded management and security consulting firm Giuliani Partners in 2002, which he left in 2007 when he campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination and questions were raised about his foreign business ties.  The firm’s clients have included Colombia and, reportedly, the government of Qatar. Giuliani appears to have resumed work with the firm after his 2007 failed presidential bid, and is listed as chairman and chief executive officer of Giuliani Partners on the Giuliani Security and Safety website. He joined a Texas law firm as a name partner in 2005. The firm did lobbying work for Citgo, a U.S. subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, which at the time was  controlled by President Hugo Chavez, Venezuela’s late socialist ruler. At the time, Giuliani’s office said he was not personally involved in the lobbying and said Giuliani believed that “Chavez is not a friend of the United States.” Giuliani’s dealings in Russia may face scrutiny in Senate confirmation hearings. His ties to TriGlobal Strategic Ventures, a consulting firm that helps Western clients advance their business interests in emerging markets of the former Soviet Union, date back to 2004, when Giuliani visited Moscow to meet Russian businessmen and politicians, according to the company’s website. The consulting firm’s president, Vitaly Pruss, has “created and developed strategies” for companies including Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft and has “worked closely” with Giuliani Partners, according to his profile on TriGlobal’s website. State-owned Transneft was among Russian oil companies targeted with sanctions by Western powers following Russia’s annexation of Crimea under President Vladimir Putin. Giuliani also has spoken in support of the People’s Mujahedin Organization of Iran, a group of Islamic leftists who opposed Iran’s late shah, but fell out with the Shi’ite clerics who took power after the 1979 revolution and later aligned itself with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The U.S. government considered it a terrorist organization until 2012. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who also was a contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, told CNN on Tuesday he was worried about Giuliani’s ties to foreign governments.     “Whether or not you have divided loyalties obviously is very important,” Paul said. “I hope Donald Trump will pick somebody consistent with what he said on the campaign trail - Iraq war was a mistake, regime change in the Middle East is a mistake. “You want to have a diplomat in charge of diplomacy,” he said. Critics, however, say the bottom line is that Giuliani is no diplomat, either personally or professionally.    “The challenge for Giuliani if he becomes secretary of state would be to move beyond the tough guy persona he cultivated as prosecutor and mayor and instead stand up for some of the basic principles of human rights, democratic accountability, and the rule of law that enhance rather than shrink America’s influence abroad,” said Ken Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who worked for Giuliani when he was a federal prosecutor between 1983 and 1987.",politicsNews,"November 16, 2016 ",1

2218,"Trump Just Did Something REALLY Weird On Twitter, And It Makes Him Look EXTREMELY Shady (IMAGE)","Donald Trump really doesn t make sticky situations any better for himself.Trump s entanglements with Russia continue to be a growing story, and a more recent piece to this puzzle came into play as Trump s Attorney General Jeff Sessions was accused of perjury over his communications with Russia. But if Trump was somehow trying to clean up his image and maintain a low profile, the fact that he  liked  a tweet about Senator Al Franken accusing Sessions of perjury certainly isn t going to help:The fact that Trump would publicly  like  a story about one of his biggest scandals only proves how insane he is. Every part of the Fox News story that Trump is calling attention to is negative, and portrays Sessions as someone who lied under oath because all of his arguments were so weak. And that s not all  the story shows that there was a THIRD time Sessions made contact with Russia, when before only two had been reported.To make this even more bizarre, Trump decided to like this story on the very day a poll was released that revealed most Americans were in agreement that Sessions lied under oath and should resign.Either Trump really thinks he s going to get away with all of this no matter how bold he is, or he s really that stupid. Considering that these actions are coming from the same man that bragged about how he could go out on a popular New York street and shoot someone without losing any votes, he really just might be that confident that he is going to skate by all of these accusations and investigations. Trump has never been one for subtlety, and he probably enjoys pushing the envelope and seeing what he can actually get away with. He needs to stop making fools out of the American people, and he must be held accountable for his actions.",News,"March 9, 2017",0
1713,"In Mexico visit, Trump's defense chief talks trust, respect","Distancing himself from political tensions over issues like the border wall, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he aimed to build trust and show respect for Mexico during a trip there on Friday that sought to buttress still resilient military ties between the two countries. U.S.-Mexican relations have been badly damaged by Trump’s threats to curtail trade with Latin America’s No. 2 economy as well as his demand that Mexico pay for a border wall to keep out immigrants and drug traffickers.     Mexicans’ positive image of the United States has fallen to its lowest level since at least 2002, with about two-thirds of people viewing the country unfavorably, according to a poll released on Thursday by the U.S.-based Pew Research Center. But Mattis portrayed U.S.-Mexican military ties as strong, saying both countries shared common concerns about issues that include drug trafficking in Mexico but also drug consumption in the United States that fuels the illicit industry. Asked how he would navigate the political tensions, Mattis said: “We have shared security concerns. There’s partnerships, military-to-military exchanges, that are based on trust and respect.” “I’m going down to build the trust and show the respect on their Independence Day,” Mattis said.  He stayed above the political fray when asked about the most contentious issues between the two countries. Questioned about his role in the border wall issue, Mattis said there was no U.S. military role in enforcing the borders.  The New York Times quoted Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, suggesting Mexico was on the verge of collapse and comparing it to Venezuela under former President Huge Chavez. Asked whether he thought Mexico was on the verge of collapse, Mattis said flatly: “No.” “Every nation has its challenges it deals with. And Mexico is keenly aware of these and I’m there to support them in dealing with them,” Mattis said. Mattis also said he would also “absolutely” express condolences for Mexican victims of a recent earthquake that struck the country, killing 96 people. Mexico is also hosting Admiral John Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations, the Navy’s highest uniformed officer, and General Lori Robinson, the head of U.S. Northern Command, for its Independence Day activities. Mattis is the first U.S. defense secretary to attend the events.  Although Mexico’s official Independence Day is on Sept. 16, most celebrations take place on Sept. 15. The event commemorates the launch of Mexico’s war of independence from Spain in 1810. The fact that such senior U.S. military officials would be visiting for such an important national event is itself notable. Mexicans have a long memory of the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which led to Mexico’s loss of almost half its territory to the United States. The war has made U.S.-Mexican military cooperation a somewhat sensitive subject in Mexico. In an apparent nod to Mexican sensitivities, Mattis called the ties between the two militaries “very strong, quiet.”  There are signs of improving U.S.-Mexican cooperation in cracking down on the heroin trade. Reuters reported in April that Mexico’s army was allowing the United States and the United Nations to observe opium poppy eradication.  The Mexican army took U.S. military officials on helicopter tours of half a dozen sites in Sinaloa and Chihuahua, two of the three states that along with Durango make up the Golden Triangle where most Mexican opium is produced, one of the sources said at the time.",politicsNews,"September 15, 2017 ",1

8455,Clinton names Obama veterans to White House transition team,"Looking to lay the groundwork for her presidency if she wins the White House in November, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton named several veterans of President Barack Obama’s administration for her transition team on Tuesday. Ken Salazar, a former interior secretary and U.S. Senator from Colorado, will lead a team of four co-chairs including one-time national security adviser Tom Donilon and Neera Tanden, a former Obama aide who now leads the progressive Center for American Progress think-tank, the Clinton campaign said. The other co-chairs are former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and Maggie Williams, director of Harvard’s Institute of Politics, the campaign said in a statement. The announcement came as Clinton has gained momentum in the opinion polls against Republican rival Donald Trump, whose campaign has struggled after he made a string of controversial remarks since formally winning his party’s nomination last month. Clinton leads Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election by more than 5 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Friday. The current RealClearPolitics average of polls shows her 6.7 points ahead. Clinton has been a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady and her transition team includes old names from her long tenure in Washington, some of whom have also served Obama. Tanden, who played a key role in shaping Obama’s health care overhaul, is a longtime friend and adviser to Clinton who worked on her Senate campaign. Williams was the 1992 transition director for Clinton when she became first lady, and then her chief of staff in the White House when Bill Clinton was president. Two policy advisers on the campaign, Ed Meier and Ann O’Leary, will also move full time to the transition team.  Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, will be the chief economist, the campaign said in a statement. Boushey has advised the campaign on economic policy. Transition teams oversee personnel appointments and help develop an administrative framework during the period between the November election and the inauguration in January, to make it easier for a new president to begin implementing policy agendas. Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, picked New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to head his own transition team in May. More establishment Republicans, alarmed by Trump’s inability or unwillingness to rein in his provocative remarks, have distanced themselves from the candidate in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal, a leading conservative voice, said in an editorial on Monday that he should fix his campaign in the next three weeks or hand over to his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Trump drew heavy criticism after engaging in a prolonged spat with the parents of a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq. Last week, he suggested gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement critics found alarming but which he later said was aimed at rallying votes against her. Trump also called Obama and Clinton the “co-founders” of Islamic State, a false claim he later said was sarcastic but did not wholly abandon. Despite Clinton’s lead in polls, Obama warned Democrats against over confidence, telling a fundraising gathering on Monday in Massachusetts, “If we are not running scared until the day after the election, we are going to be making a grave mistake.”",politicsNews,"August 16, 2016 ",0
7099,"Willing to oppose Trump, some Senate Republicans gain leverage","It is no surprise that Democrats in the U.S. Congress will oppose Donald Trump but the most important resistance to fulfilling the president-elect’s agenda is beginning to emerge from Republicans on Capitol Hill. A small number of influential Republicans in the Senate are threatening to block appointments to Trump’s administration, derail his thaw with Russia and prevent the planned wall on the border with Mexico. The party held onto control of the Senate at the Nov. 8 election but by only a thin margin, putting powerful swing votes in just a few hands. That empowers Republican Senate mavericks such as Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. Both were bitter rivals to Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary.  Paul, a libertarian lone wolf, says he will block Senate confirmations if Trump nominates either former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani or former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton to be secretary of state. South Carolina’s Lindsay Graham has started publicly outlining places he might be willing to oppose Trump. He is against the Mexican border wall and is delivering warnings against Trump’s intention to revoke legal status for undocumented immigrants brought here as children - although that would not require congressional approval.  Graham, a traditional Republican foreign policy hawk, strongly disagrees with Trump’s attempt to improve ties with Russia. “I am going to be kind of a hard ass” on Russia, Graham told reporters recently. “We can’t sit on the sidelines” and let cyber attacks blamed on Russia “go unanswered.”             The early stirrings of opposition from Senate Republicans are a sign that the New York businessman, who has never held public office, might run into harsh political realities soon after taking office on Jan. 20.         Other Senators who might defy Trump are Arizona’s John McCain and Jeff Flake, Nebraska’s Ben Sasse, Florida’s Marco Rubio, Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, said senior Senate aides and lawmakers.     These lawmakers have ruffled feathers in the past and some have a good political reason not to fear Trump: Paul, McCain, Murkowski and Rubio do not have to run for reelection until 2022. Graham, Collins and Sasse will have to face the voters in 2020; Cruz and Flake have an earlier election, in 2018. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose job is to keep the Republicans in line, knows the challenges ahead. A senior Republican aide said McConnell is “loathe” to spend time trying to move bills that lack the needed Senate votes.  McConnell is aware he will not have the support of some of his own lawmakers on bills that could pass the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, such as appropriating money to build the Mexican wall and further abortion restrictions, the aide said. But Trump has a history of taming what appear to be well-entrenched Republican opponents. He won the party nomination against all the odds and some of his staunchest opponents like Rubio and Cruz ended up endorsing him.         And swing votes in the Senate cut two ways. The Democrats have their own potential renegades such as West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, who has already declared his support for Trump’s nomination of Republican Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Such swings by Democrats toward Republicans may be likelier ahead of the 2018 elections, when Democrats must defend more vulnerable Senate seats than Republicans. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer must deal with this. Trump said over the weekend he and Schumer “always had a good relationship.” Republicans are likely to control only 52 seats in the 100-seat Senate, meaning three defections within the party are enough to block cabinet appointments which only require 50 votes. Vice President-elect Mike Pence would break 50-50 ties. The task for McConnell gets more difficult when it comes to passing legislation, which requires 60 votes, known as cloture, to allow a bill to move forward. If Trump plans to sign a bill while in office, perhaps one that will change immigration law or restrict abortions, McConnell will have to keep all Republicans in line and win over an additional eight Democrats. Trump could deliver on campaign promises that do not require legislative approval like blocking the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal or ending the Iran nuclear pact. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, enjoys robust Republican support and would be done through a legislative maneuver that does not require any Democratic support.  Collins and Murkowski have a history of crossing the aisle to join Democrats and could shy from abortion restrictions. Cruz has never feared disrupting Senate business to prove a point or seek concessions in legislation.  Sasse did not waver from his staunch criticism of Trump through the campaign. Flake has said he is “eating crow” after Trump’s win, but he could defect on immigration and border security, issues he has previously joined with Democrats on. Paul was asked last week on MSNBC if he would put a hold on Giuliani or Bolton. In the Senate, a hold allows a single senator to delay a confirmation. He left open the possibility of such a move, saying, “I feel pretty strongly about it.”  He said: “We have a 52-48 majority, all it would take is two or three Republicans to say they can’t go along with Giuliani and can’t go along with Bolton.”",politicsNews,"November 22, 2016 ",0
14976,Smog chokes Indian capital as emergency measures fail to bring relief,"A thick cloud of toxic smog 10 times the recommended limit enveloped India s capital, New Delhi, on Monday, as government officials struggled to tackle a public health crisis that is well into its second week. A U.S. embassy measure showed levels of poisonous airborne particles, known as PM 2.5, had reached 498 on Monday afternoon, compared with the upper limit of  good  quality air at 50. India s weather office said rain was forecast over the next three days which could help clear the smog.  Light rainfall is likely in states surrounding Delhi and in Delhi over the next three days, and this could result in a change in wind pattern in the region,  Charan Singh, a scientist at India Meteorological Department, told Reuters.  Smog will start to abate starting tomorrow.  But Skymet, India s only private weather forecaster, said dense smog would continue over Delhi and the surrounding area for at least the next two days. The Supreme Court is due to hear a petition filed by a New Delhi lawyer to direct government authorities to tackle the  intolerable and unbearable air pollution . The Delhi state government declared a public health emergency last week after pollution levels spiked, a yearly phenomenon blamed on a combination of illegal crop burning in northern states, vehicle exhaust and dust. Over the weekend, authorities began using fire trucks to spray water in parts of the capital to keep the dust and other air particles down, but it has had little effect.  A senior federal government official said there was little more that could be done.  We can only do this much, and now we will have to wait for rains to clean the atmosphere,  said Prashant Gargava, an official at the Central Pollution Control Board. Gargava, who is in charge of monitoring air quality, said Delhi s air has been consistently in the  hazardous  zone, despite measures such as a halt to construction and increasing car parking charges four-fold to encourage people to use public transport. The PM 2.5 airborne particles are about 30 times finer than a human hair. The particles can be inhaled deep into the lungs, causing respiratory diseases and other ailments. Hospitals have seen a surge of patients coming in with respiratory complaints, according to media reports.  Every second we are damaging our lungs, but we cannot stop breathing,  said Arvind Kumar, the head of the chest and lung surgery department at the Sir Ganga Ram hospital. United Airlines said it had resumed flights from Newark, New Jersey, to New Delhi on Sunday, after suspending the service temporarily over concern about the bad air. Authorities decided to reopen schools on Monday after closing them temporarily for a few days last week, but the decision is likely to add more vehicles on the road.  Enforcement agencies said they were unable to impose a blanket ban on the movement of commercial trucks. Primary school teacher Aarti Menon said her family had been wearing face masks, even when indoors.  Not everyone can afford an air purifier or air-conditioned car. We are all living in hell,  said Menon, a mother of two teenage daughters. The National Green Tribunal, an environment court, has directed the city government and neighboring states to stop farmers from burning crop stubble. But the governments have not been able to do so. New Delhi-based non-government group TARA Homes for Children, which supports 60 poor children, said it was seeking donations to buy at least five air purifiers.   Some of the children have breathing issues and couldn t go to school,  said a volunteer at the group.",worldnews,"November 13, 2017 ",1
6684,Climate scientists adjust as Trump builds team of oil allies,"Climate scientists worried that President-elect Donald Trump will slash their budgets and sideline their research are entering survival mode, trimming the words “climate change” from study proposals, emphasizing business applications of their work, and safeguarding data that shows global warming is real. The early reactions, gathered by Reuters in more than a dozen interviews, may foretell a broader shift in the U.S. climate science community, which had enjoyed solid political and financial support under President Barack Obama but could be isolated under a new administration skeptical of climate change and committed to expanding oil drilling and coal mining. “I think it is maybe really necessary to refocus what you are doing and how you are labeling it,” said Andreas Prein, a scientist at the federally funded National Center for Atmospheric Research, who previously had changed the term “climate change” in a project for the oil industry and expects such linguistic twists to proliferate.  Trump has questioned whether climate change exists and has raised the possibility of withdrawing U.S. support for a global accord to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which an overwhelming majority of scientists believe is driving sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms.  Trump is also preparing to nominate cabinet members with close oil industry ties, including Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary. A member of the transition team further raised concerns among scientists this month by sending a questionnaire to the Department of Energy seeking the names of researchers there who worked on climate change issues, a move Trump’s team later disavowed. Federal funding for climate change research, technology and international assistance hit $11.6 billion in 2014, from $2.4 billion in 1993, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. While Trump has not explicitly said he would cut such funding, one of his advisers told The Guardian newspaper last month that climate research at NASA would be eliminated.  A Trump transition team official did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Prein at National Center for Atmospheric Research said he had replaced the politically charged term “climate change” with “global change” in a project he submitted for the oil industry. He said that regardless of how it is labeled, interest in climate research would likely endure given the importance of extreme weather forecasting to a broad array of industries, like insurance and energy. However, he was concerned the longer-term work crucial to understanding the scope of global warming could lose critical support. Climate scientist Ben Sanderson, also at NCAR, told Reuters he is applying to renew funding for assessing uncertainty in climate change. “Now the proposal would have to be defensible without referring to climate change explicitly, so to talk about weather risks in general,” he said. Tracey Holloway, an air quality scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said she believed simple word changes sometimes could help scientists avoid trouble. Using the term “weather” instead of “climate change,” for example, could work for studies that deal with a short-term time scale, she said. But Eric Holthaus, a meteorologist who writes for online magazine Slate, has taken efforts to protect scientists and their work a step further.  He spearhead an effort, with the support of the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Toronto, to let scientists move their data onto publicly available non-government servers. The project, called “DataRefuge,” is intended to eliminate the chances of political interference with the data, he said. The signals from the Trump transition team on climate change have also put members of Obama’s outgoing administration on edge. Current Interior Secretary Sally Jewell told scientists at a conference in San Francisco this week they must confront climate change deniers and speak up if Trump tries to sideline them. White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said in a press briefing he believed the concerns of the scientific community about Trump were “legitimate.”  “If the incoming administration determines that they want to base their policy on something other than science, it looks like they’re going to get at least four years to try that out and we’ll have an opportunity to see how it works,” he said. Other scientists were dealing with the stress of a new administration using humor. University of South Florida glaciologist Jason Gulley said his team had a list of joke projects for science under Trump. “How could we weaponize glaciers?” he asked, and what is the best real estate currently hidden under Greenland ice sheets.",politicsNews,"December 15, 2016 ",0

8665,Undocumented immigrants given roles at Democratic convention,"The Democratic Party has selected a handful of undocumented immigrants for official roles at next week’s Democratic National Convention, in a bid to highlight the gaping policy divide on immigration between White House hopeful Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump. Clinton is hoping to drive Latino voters to the polls on Nov. 8 to shore up her chances against Trump, who has campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration by building a wall along the Mexican border and deporting millions of undocumented foreigners if elected. “Our nation is a nation of immigrants that believes in being inclusive, and that’s exactly what we will continue to work toward,” said Leah Daughtry, the chief executive officer of the committee organizing the July 25-28 convention in Philadelphia. “The voices of our nation’s brave undocumented youth will be heard loud and clear,” Daughtry added. The picks include two members of the convention credentials and platform committees, as well as several speakers. The positions are unpaid, officials said. Trump’s campaign, which has argued that unchecked immigration hurts American workers and undermines national security, criticized the move. “Apparently speaking at Hillary Clinton’s convention is just one more job Hillary Clinton thinks Americans won’t do,” a Trump campaign aide said in an emailed statement. “She should have instead invited unemployed Americans, or victims of crime, or law enforcement.”  The selections are legal because of a “deferred action program” adopted by President Barack Obama’s administration, which postpones deportations and provides work authorization for some immigrants brought to the United States as children. The Supreme Court blocked efforts to expand those protections last month. The nominations mark the first time a major U.S. political party’s convention has featured so many undocumented workers among its ranks. While there was an undocumented speaker at the 2012 Democratic convention, the party has not previously tracked the immigration status of its committee members. “It changes the whole conversation when you have someone directly affected at the table,” said Cesar Vargas, a Mexican immigrant chosen for the party’s policy platform committee.  Hareth Andrade, 23, an undocumented immigrant from Bolivia who was approved under a deferred action program, was picked for the credentials committee. The convention will also feature at least two undocumented immigrant speakers, Astrid Silva and Francisca Ortiz. Clinton already has overwhelming support from minorities. Some 70 percent back her, compared with 9 percent for Trump, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos polling, suggesting that she could have a strong chance in states like Florida, Nevada and Colorado that swing between voting Democratic and Republican in presidential elections.  However, voter turnout among Latinos has traditionally been low, hitting only about 40 percent in 2012, meaning her challenge is to get more of them to cast ballots this year. Luis Fraga, co-director of the Institute for Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame, said showing a commitment to progressive reform of U.S. immigration policy could help Clinton do that.  He called immigration a gateway issue for minority voters that can help engage them. That’s especially so because even Latinos born in the United States are often not far removed from family members who are immigrants themselves.  “Although it’s not their individual experience, it is their family’s experience,” Fraga said.",politicsNews,"July 22, 2016 ",1
6218,The Shocking Detail Trump Doesn’t Want You To Know About HIS MOTHER (VIDEO),"A rather interesting detail has emerged about Donald Trump s mother that is threatening to derail part of Trump s campaign that he s heavily relied on to win over America s most racist voters.According to a recent report released by The National, Trump s mother, Mary Anne Macleod, was actually a poor Scottish immigrant that came to the United States to make a better life for herself   a realization that stands in stark contrast to the story the business mogul has been telling.It shouldn t come as a shock that The Donald would hide the fact that his mother came to America with nothing but $50 in her purse. Why wouldn t he want people to know that his mother came to the country dirt poor and became a multi-millionaire philanthropist, other than the fact that he has slammed immigrants all throughout his presidential campaign? After all, his website says this: The influx of foreign workers holds down salaries, keeps unemployment high, and makes it difficult for poor and working-class Americans   including immigrants themselves and their children   to earn a middle-class wage. Nearly half of all immigrants and their US-born children currently live in or near poverty, including more than 60 per cent of Hispanic immigrants.Every year, we voluntarily admit another two million new immigrants, guest workers, refugees, and dependents, growing our existing all-time historic record population of 42 million immigrants.We need to control the admission of new low-earning workers in order to: help wages grow, get teenagers back to work, aid minorities  rise into the middle class, help schools and communities falling behind, and to ensure our immigrant members of the national family become part of the American dream. The  low-earning worker  that Trump is trashing on his website is the very person his mother was when she left Scotland to come to America in 1930. Despite that he has his mother to thank for the opportunities he was given, Trump can still find it in himself to say foolish, hateful things like, We re building a wall. It s going to be a wall that is not   nobody s going through my wall. Trump builds walls. I build walls. The report by The National isn t the first time the fact that Trump is the son of an immigrant has threatened to ruin his hateful anti-immigrant rhetoric. Earlier this year, Trump s former GOP rival Ted Cruz called Trump out during a childish  birther  fight. Cruz said: The legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on, some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S. soil, but have two parents born on U.S. soil. Under that theory, not only would I be disqualified, Marco Rubio would be disqualified, Bobby Jindal would be disqualified, and interestingly enough, Donald J. Trump would be disqualified because Donald s mother was born in Scotland, You can watch that moment below:But before Cruz, Real Time s Bill Baher did an even more amazing job at highlighting the hypocrisy in Trump s immigration stance   and it goes much deeper than his own mother. Laying into the presumptive Republican nominee, Maher pointed out that two out of three of Trump s wives have been immigrants. Maher said: Nobody brings this up about Donald Trump, who is always on about,  We can t have foreigners coming into this country!  His first wife is from Czechoslovakia. His current wife is from Slovenia. So, if you think crawling under a wall is the most disgusting way to become an American, somewhere there is a Panamanian woman hiding in a truck full of chickens with ten pounds of heroin-filled condoms in her stomach who s thinking,  Well, at least I didn t have to blow Donald Trump.

3845,BREAKING: Stunning Development In Trump Fraud Case Shows How Terrifyingly Deep His Corruption Will Go,"The federal judge overseeing two of the three fraud cases against Donald Trump has advised all parties to settle  given all else that s involved.  Presumably, he s talking about Trump s disgustingly shocking win on Election Day. It looked a lot like Trump might actually be held accountable for his actions despite the win, but now the trial might not even take place.Curiel said: It would be wise for the plaintiffs, for the defendants, to look closely at trying to resolve this case given all else that s involved. He also said he d allow Trump to testify via video due to his new obligations in Washington. Besides that, he told Trump s lawyers that they could again request that specific campaign statements be withheld from both the jury and himself.Earlier, Addicting Info writer Wendy Gittleson reported that a lawyer believes Trump could be impeached very quickly after taking office because of these lawsuits. All three suits involve charges of fraud and racketeering. The reasoning was that there s a question of whether the legal aspects involved in these cases could  rise to the level of impeachment. If they did, it would probably be goodbye Trump since Congress wasn t too keen on him anyway.However, with Curiel advising the parties involved in the suits in his court to settle, it could actually quietly go away with Trump paying less than he might have otherwise, and it could remove a potential block to four years of Trump in the White House.Earlier this month, the woman who was suing Trump for rape dropped her case after receiving death threats. She had canceled a press conference, too, out of fear for her safety and life. This is the woman that accused Trump of raping her when she was 13, and it s very, very likely she was terrorized into dropping the suit.There s still a fraud case relating to Trump U. pending in the New York attorney general s office. Other than that, it s entirely possible that Trump will, more or less, get away with a slap on the wrist for this, depending on whether the plaintiffs agree to settle and agree to whatever Trump proposes as a settlement.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",News,"November 10, 2016",1

19499,MASSIVE MI VOTER FRAUD UNCOVERED? 59% Of Detroit Vote Counting Machines Didn’t Work On Election Day…Ballots May Have Been Counted Several Times…Votes Were Certified Anyway,"One-third of precincts in Wayne County could be disqualified from an unprecedented statewide recount of presidential election results because of problems with ballots.Michigan s largest county voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but officials couldn t reconcile vote totals for 610 of 1,680 precincts during a countywide canvass of vote results late last month.Most of those are in heavily Democratic Detroit, where the number of ballots in precinct poll books did not match those of voting machine printout reports in 59 percent of precincts, 392 of 662.According to state law, precincts whose poll books don t match with ballots can t be recounted. If that happens, original election results stand. It s not good,  conceded Daniel Baxter, elections director for the city of Detroit.He blamed the discrepancies on the city s decade-old voting machines, saying 87 optical scanners broke on Election Day. Many jammed when voters fed ballots into scanners, which can result in erroneous vote counts if ballots are inserted multiple times. Poll workers are supposed to adjust counters to reflect a single vote but in many cases failed to do so, causing the discrepancies, Baxter said.Even so, Baxter said it s unlikely all 392 of the city s precincts with mismatched numbers will be disqualified from a recount. The city is in contact with elections officials at the state of Michigan and Baxter predicted the numbers will match when the ballot boxes are re-opened for the recount, which starts Tuesday in Wayne County at Cobo Center. It s a challenge, but we re confident the ballots will match,  Baxter said.  I don t think it s going to be 100 percent, but it never is with a recount. County reports obtained by The Detroit News, though, indicate canvassers were provided no explanation for why the numbers didn t add up in those precincts. They certified the results of the election anyway.U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith ordered the hand recount of 4.8 million ballots just after midnight Monday, granting a motion in favor of Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. It began Monday in Oakland and Ingham counties and continues at 9 a.m. Tuesday in Kalamazoo, Kent, Macomb, Ottawa, Washtenaw and Wayne counties.The recount will begin throughout the rest of Michigan s 83 counties in phases this week.Republican President-elect Donald Trump won Michigan by a razor-thin margin, 10,704 votes. Presumably, Clinton s best opportunity to eliminate that margin rested in finding uncounted ballots in Wayne County, which she carried by a 2-1 ratio.Besides Wayne, Clinton carried Oakland, Washtenaw, Genesee, Ingham, Kalamazoo, Marquette and Muskegon counties.None had nearly as many problems as Wayne. But at least 13 of 222 precincts in Genesee County are not balanced. More than half of those were in heavily Democratic Flint, according to county canvassing reports. The election was still certified by its board of canvassers. The trouble is there s too much leniency with the board of canvassers,  said John Gleason, Genesee County s clerk.  They re not as stringent as need to be because they think it won t affect the outcome of the election. Gleason, who estimated the recount will cost the cash-strapped county $100,000, said he expects the numbers to reconcile when workers begin the county recount on Wednesday. It s impossible to tell at this point how many will and how many won t be re-countable,  added Joseph Rozell, elections director for Oakland County.In the first six hours of Ingham County s recount Monday, six of 30 precincts from Lansing could not be recounted. One of the ballot containers had a hole in it, making it susceptible to tampering and not recountable, county Clerk Barb Byrum said.Two tries to match numbersState law spells out a prescribed criteria for determining whether a precinct can be recounted. Workers first check to make sure the number of ballots on the seal of the container matches the ballots recorded by workers on Election Day. If the seal number matches, then we know it s not been tampered with,  Rozell said.If numbers don t match, then workers can count all of the ballots in the precinct twice to see if there was an error made by workers on Election Night. If it does not match after the second count, then it s not recountable,  Rozell said.Entire precincts can be set aside in a recount if the ballots are stored in an unapproved container or if it isn t properly sealed.At Ingham County s recount operation Monday at the county s fairgrounds in Mason, ballots were stored in suitcase-like containers that were sealed with plastic zip-ties that had to be cut for workers to take out the ballots.Byrum plans to have the ballot bags guarded each night during the recount by a sheriff s deputy.

However, Donald Trump turned the whole race upside down, and Bush never made it out of the single digits. As the South Carolina Primary draws to a close with yet another poor showing in what is widely seen as one of the most important primaries of the election season, supporters of other GOP candidates urge Bush to drop out. Florida Senator Tim Scott, who is backing Marco Rubio, says of Bush s candidacy and how it affects the GOP s chances at the White House: It s hard to tell you what the Bush camp is thinking. He served as a great governor. I think it d be a great opportunity for him to bring his folks over to the Rubio camp. But the reality is everyone who is running wants to do something good for America, so the question is, once you realize that s not going to happen, what do you do next? It s hard to answer that question unless you re the candidate. Sen. Scott wasn t the only one to call for Bush s withdrawal from the race.

John Kasich strategist and supporter John Weaver said of the South Carolina outcome: Only four candidates have top-three finishes in any of the early states and can justify staying in. At the same time, John Kasich has now won the so-called  Governors Bracket  by continuing to run strong and beat expectations.

18867,FLASHBACK VIDEO Shows Leftist Media Members Praising Use Of “Nuclear Option” To Confirm (LIBERAL) Supreme Court Justices,"With Senate Republicans poised to use the  nuclear option  to confirm Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, will the liberal media hypocritically accuse them of a power grab? In 2013, when then-Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid did basically the same thing, he was cheered on in the studios of MSNBC and CNN.Back then MSNBC s Chris Hayes hailed it as  an affirmative win for democracy,  while his colleague Rachel Maddow blurted  This is a huge freaking deal. This is like 3-inch headlines. This is like people who don t even care about politics really ought to care about this. Over on CNN, political analyst Paul Begala hailed the nakedly partisan maneuver by Reid as necessary, whining that Republicans had  so abused  the filibuster that Democrats  can t take it anymore.  And Begala s colleague Ron Brownstein approved of Reid s decision as a forward-thinking move:  The idea of requiring a super majority for the president to appoint his nominees just is anachronistic. But the cable network news hosts and analysts weren t the only ones championing the nuclear option. On the pages of the Los Angeles Times, Reid s move was celebrated in a November 22 editorial  Democrats bust the filibuster, and good for them. The Times editorial board crowed:  We welcome this action not because it represents a comeuppance for arrogant Republicans but because filibustering presidential nominees is undemocratic and violates the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution, which says that the president shall appoint judges and other officials  by and with the advice and consent of the Senate    not by and with a supermajority of the Senate.

12377,Meet The LEFTIST Assistant Professor Who Made Up Bogus List Of “Fake” Conservative Websites That Went Viral,"Approximately one year ago, my business partner sent me a screen shot of a list of  phony  or  not to be trusted  websites  that was going around Facebook. Our website (100percentfedup.com), along with several other conservative websites like Breitbart, IJ Review, Infowars, Biz Pac Review and The Blaze were included on this list. Most of the websites listed had a considerable amount of traffic and cumulatively reach hundreds of millions of readers. I told her to ignore it, that it was clearly created by some leftist organization who was trying to discredit conservative websites. One year later, a list that has striking similarities has been revived. This time however, the list has been amended to include ONE liberal website,  Occupy Democrats  and has a new author, Melissa Zimdars. After all, a list of 90  phony  or  misleading  websites wouldn t be legitimate if at least one of them wasn t a liberal site right?While some of the websites on the list are fake and should be called out as such, there are WAY more legitimate conservative sites on this list who work very hard to vet their sources and to bring their readers truthful news they won t find in the mainstream media. After the election results came in, many on the Left were inconsolable and were lashing out at conservative news sites as the reason Hillary lost. It didn t take long for the Left to realize they had finally met their match with driven conservatives who were not going to roll over and let the Left drive the narrative this time around. Thus the list by Leftist activist Melissa Zimdars, that is being used to discredit many of us who take our jobs very seriously, and are doing all that we can to fight back against a biased media complex.We were curious about Melissa and her political leanings. Could this list have anything to do with wanting to  pay back  the sites who helped to topple Hillary? We did a little research on Melissa and found that her Twitter account is on lock-down. We found this to be slightly ironic considering she appears to be all about transparency. Thanks to Way Back Time Machine, we were able to find out a little bit about Melissa:Melissa is a follower of The Radical  Chicago Rising  and  The End Of Protest  who describes their group as  A new playbook for revolution by Micah White, co-creator of Occupy Wall Street: Melissa is big fan of Black Lives Matter, and was helping to promote the BLM march that threatened the safety and security of many innocent people in Chicago:Here s the real reason why Zimdar likely has her Twitter account on lockdown. She wouldn t want to let everyone know she just published a list of conservative sites that she suggests,  should never be trusted  and allow her hatred for Donald Trump to be exposed at the same time. Besides her hatred for Trump and Karl Rove (see below), she apparently gets  goosebumps  when she hears Bernie Sanders  name. I know what you re thinking She s sounding more  objective  all the time right?Melissa retweeted Hillary s angry tweet about Trump:She s no fan of Dr. Ben Carson and his belief that the government shouldn t be able to force employers to pay an arbitrary minimum wage:Melissa s story became popular after she posted it to her Facebook page, which should come as no surprise given the  friends  who are actively suggesting names of other conservative sites they detest that  Melissa needs to add to the her list. Even though Breitbart is on her  list , Zimdar s friend asks her,  Where s Brietbart? Other friends want to know how they can submit conservative sites that can be added to her list:And of course, what kind of conservative media  hit list  would be complete without Fox News? This friend suggests she needs to put FOX News at the  top  of the list:This Hillary supporter tells Zimdar she d like to use this list as a teaching tool in her class:Just another liberal agitator who plans to use this list to teach her students about honest journalism.Here is Zimdar admitting that not every site is always unreliable, that some,  waffle back and forth .

21093,"BRITISH MAN GOES UNDERCOVER, Makes Chilling Video In “Welcoming” Neighborhood Mosque","If she doesn t wear a hijab, we hit her This is truly a shocking undercover film. It exposes the wide network of Muslim radicals and how they have no intention of assimilating with Westerners.  The things that are said in this film should make every American and European question what really takes place in these  neighborhood mosques. Marrying off a girl before puberty is permissible. None of this has been stopped in Britain by the government, who did not care to protect thousands of children raped, threatened, sold, drugged and many even killed by Muslim men. This mentality amongst Muslims that the video shows, especially Sunni Muslims, will be common in virtually every single mosque not only in Britain, but throughout Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the US.The Muslim hatred continues to flourish throughout the country, all because of a weak and incompetent leadership and EU policies that protect hate preachers and terrorism. The permission for Islam to grow and exist   a fascist ideology of the medieval ages   is the root cause of growing terrorism growing and expanding into the West.It is not difficult to see what Britain s future will be. Islam is a far greater threat than Nazism. But the Nazi s did not infiltrate the country and was easier to battle.Prime Minister Tony Blair recently described tolerance as  what makes Britain Britain  but in this extensive investigation Dispatches reveals how a message of hatred and segregation is being spread throughout the UK and examines how it is influenced by the religious establishment of Saudi Arabia.Dispatches has investigated a number of mosques run by high profile national organisations that claim to be dedicated to moderation and dialogue with other faiths. But an undercover reporter joined worshippers to find a message of religious bigotry and extremism being preached.He captures chilling sermons in which Saudi-trained preachers proclaim the supremacy of Islam, preach hatred for non-Muslims and for Muslims who do not follow their extreme beliefs   and predict a coming jihad.  An army of Muslims will arise,  announces one preacher. Another preacher said British Muslims must  dismantle  British democracy   they must  live like a state within a state  until they are  strong enough to take over. The investigation reveals Saudi Arabian universities are recruiting young Western Muslims to train them in their extreme theology, then sending them back to the West to spread the word.

11877,Merkel admits mistakes in the 2016 Christmas market attack,"Germany should learn from security shortcomings exposed by a deadly truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market a year ago and increase aid to survivors and families of victims, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday. Anis Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker with Islamist links, hijacked a truck on Dec. 19, 2016, killed the driver and then plowed it into a crowded market place, killing 11 more people and injuring dozens of others. Merkel spoke on the anniversary of the attack at the unveiling of a memorial on the Breitscheidplatz square where it took place. The ceremony came amid criticism from families of the victims and from survivors about the government s handling of the incident.  Today is a day for mourning but also a day for the determination of making things better that did not work (in the past),  Merkel said. Merkel, who met victims and relatives of those killed at the chancellery on Monday, said she would meet the group again in a few months to provide updates on lessons learned from Germany s worst Islamist militant attack. Hundreds of people gathered with candles at the site after a  church service at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church that was also attended by Berlin mayor Michael Mueller and former German President Joachim Gauck.  The church bells tolled for 12 minutes, one minute for each of those killed, at 8:02 p.m., the precise time when the attack occurred. The normally crowded Christmas market at the plaza remained closed all day on Tuesday. The memorial shows the names of the victims carved on the steps of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church near the scene of the attack. A long crack filled with metal and gold alloy runs through the steps and the Christmas market.     President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said support for the victims of the attack came late and had not been sufficient.  It s bitter that the state could not protect your relatives,  Steinmeier said addressing the families. German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said the government had not been well enough prepared to avert such an attack.  We can only apologize for the victims and the surviving relatives,  Maas wrote in an article published in Tagesspiegel paper on Tuesday.  The German government has agreed to increase compensation payments to victims  families and survivors after complaints that the 10,000 euros ($11,820) compensation the German government had offered was insufficient, Kurt Beck, an advocate for victims and survivors said on Tuesday. Dozens of protesters rallied near the Breitscheidplatz, carrying signs expressing solidarity with the victims but warning against turning the tragic event into a rallying cry against Islam, as some far-right groups have sought to do.  I m angry about the right wing s efforts to instrumentalize this,  said Martin Pfaff, who organized the event.  That s why we re making clear that racism cannot be an answer to terrorism.",worldnews,"December 19, 2017 ",1
11246,"For Republican Rubio, a moment of truth in race to lead U.S.","Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party’s 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa’s Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. “I feel good but we’ve got to close strong,” said Rubio’s New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. “There’s a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn’t fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that’s causing some pause,” Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. “He hasn’t had any experience running anything,” Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. “He did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn’t run anything.” Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio’s schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio’s path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. “From the get-go we said we didn’t want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It’s starting to grow. It feels like it’s starting to happen for us,” Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. “I think he suffered from the perception that he hasn’t been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,” Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. “If he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.” For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, “Tales from the Trail” (here).",politicsNews,"January 13, 2016 ",1

Why is the media, who has been virtually silent about former DNC staffer Seth Rich s death until now, coming out to attack President Trump and his administration, accusing them of pushing a false narrative about his murder? Shouldn t every American regardless of political affiliation want to get to the bottom of Rich s suspicious death? Why is there so much secrecy and mystery surrounding the staffer who was getting ready to move over to the Hillary campaign when he was murdered on the streets of DC, only blocks from his home early in the morning, after he was last seen leaving a local bar he frequented. The DC police called it a robbery. The  robbers  didn t take his wallet, the contents of his wallet or his expensive watch.Aaron Rich, who had reportedly been blocking his family s private investigator from looking into whether or not his brother Seth was a WikiLeaks source, works for an influential defense contractor that provides cyber security.According to a source close to the Rich family, Aaron works for Northrup Grumman, which was named as the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world in 2015. The source did not provide what his specific role is at the company. It s not just hacking and defending, there s a lot more to it,  a cyber software engineer at Northrup Grumman says in a video on the company s website.As we previously reported, Aaron Rich was actively attempting to shut down anyone looking into the WikiLeaks connection according to Rod Wheeler, who was brought on as a private investigator in his brother s murder case.Wheeler said that brother Aaron Rich tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth s computer, even though there could be evidence on it.  He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,  Wheeler said.  I said, well can I look at it? He said, what are you looking for? I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone. He said no, I already checked it. Don t worry about it. Aaron also blocked Wheeler from finding out about who was at a party Seth attended the night of the murder. All I want you to do is work on the botched robbery theory and that s it,  Aaron told Wheeler, according to Wheeler s claim on the audio. Wheeler said that Seth s father Joel  does not appear to have any hidden agenda. Rich was shot in the back in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016, near his home while he was on the phone with his girlfriend   12 days before the publication of the DNC emails by WikiLeaks. The police initially ruled that it was a botched robbery   but his wallet, watch, and necklace were still on his person when he was discovered by police.Big League Politics has also released an audio recording of journalist Seymour Hersh stating that Seth Rich was in fact WikiLeaks  source.Listen to the Seymour Hersh interview here: All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I m sure dozens of emails, and said  I want money.  Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,  he said. They got access to the DropBox. Hersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him,  the word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that  if anything happens to me it s not going to solve your problems,  he added.

15084,Indonesian forces prepare to storm Papua villages held by rebels,"Indonesian security forces in the eastern province of Papua are preparing to storm five villages that they say are being held by an armed rebel group, police officials said on Saturday. Around 200 police and military personnel have been deployed and are awaiting orders to secure the area, where an armed separatist group linked to the Free Papua Movement (OPM) is preventing about 1,000 people from leaving an area near a giant copper mine, operated by the American miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc. [nL3N1NG46N]  Today the joint police and military forces have occupied various posts to be able to take action,  said Papua police spokesman, Suryadi Diaz.  They will be taken dead or alive,  he said of the around 100 rebels that police say have tortured and abused the villagers since taking over the area several days ago. A state of emergency has been declared in the area and at least 300 additional security forces have been deployed to the area of the province after a string of shootings since Aug. 17 that killed one police officer and wounded six.  The rebel group, the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPN-OPM), on Friday denied occupying villages near the mine, but said it was  at war  with the police, military, and Freeport. Papua has had a long-running and sometimes violent separatist movement since it was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969. President Joko Widodo has sought to ease tension in the two provinces by stepping up investment, freeing political prisoners and addressing human rights concerns. This is the first escalation of violence during his term. Freeport s Grasberg mine has been dogged by security concerns for decades due to a low-level conflict waged by pro-independence rebels in Papua. Between 2009 and 2015, shootings within the mine project area killed 20 people and wounded 59. More recently, Freeport, the world s largest publicly listed copper producer, has been grappling with labor problems at Grasberg and a dispute with the Indonesian government over rights to the mine.[nL2N1N00LD]",worldnews,"November 11, 2017 ",1

The gunman was also injured and was taken to the hospital.The gunman reportedly tried to go through metal detectors with the weapon. When the detectors went off, and security confronted the man, he pulled out his gun, when he was shot by a police officer.The Capitol and buildings in the area were placed on lockdown for roughly half an hour, causing some confusion as there was a lockdown drill in the Capitol earlier this morning. The visitor center is still closed, but the House and Senate reopened for official business purposes only. Although Congress is not currently in session due to a break for Easter, Washington DC is flooded with tourists this time of year for its annual Cherry Blossom Festival.The incident was deemed as isolated by local police.The visitor center at the Capitol was built via an underground center with high security after two Capitol police officers were killed in 1998 by a paranoid schizophrenic who entered the building and opened fire in 1998. Similar incidents have historically occurred at the Capitol as it is a high target for gunmen who want to ensure they receive national media attention.In April 2015, a male entered the Capitol building with a gun and committed suicide.Details from the Capitol shooting today are still emerging as to who the shooter is, what is plans were, and what were his motives for trying to bring a gun into the Capitol.Featured image courtesy of Flickr",News,"March 28, 2016",0
19160,"Kurds stick with independence vote, 'never going back to Baghdad': Barzani","Iraq s Kurds will go ahead with a referendum on independence on Monday because their partnership with Baghdad has failed, Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani said on Sunday, shrugging off international opposition to the vote. In response, the Iraqi government asked the autonomous Kurdish region to hand over control of its international border posts, its international airports and called on foreign countries to stop importing Kurdish crude oil. It asked  the neighboring countries and the countries of the world to deal exclusively with the federal government of Iraq in regards to entry posts and oil,   according to a statement from Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi s office. The United States and other Western powers have urged Kurdish authorities in the oil producing region to cancel the vote, arguing that it distracts from the fight against Islamic State. Turkey and Iran have also kept up the pressure to stop the vote, with presidents Tayyip Erdogan and Hassan Rouhani speaking by phone and expressing concern that it will  bring chaos in the region , according to Erdogan s office. Barzani, at a news conference at his headquarters near Erbil, dismissed the worries of Iraq s neighbors, committing to respect laws on international boundaries and not seek to redraw the region s borders.  We will never go back to the failed partnership  with Baghdad, he said, adding Iraq had become a  theocratic, sectarian state  and not the democratic one that was supposed to be built after the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein. The vote, expected to result in a comfortable  yes  to  independence, is not binding and is meant to give the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) a mandate to negotiate secession with Baghdad and the neighboring countries. Barzani said Iraq s Kurds would seek talks with the Shi ite-led central government to implement the expected  yes  outcome, even if they take two years or more, to settle land and oil sharing disputes ahead of independence. Abadi s government in Iraq regards the referendum as anti-constitutional and in a televised address on Sunday he said it  could lead to ethnic divisions, exposing (the Iraqis) to disastrous dangers that only God knows.  Earlier, Iranian authorities stopped air traffic to Iraqi Kurdistan s international airports at Erbil and Sulaimaniya in response to a request from Baghdad, Fars News Agency said.      Iran also started war games at the Kurdish border. Speaking by telephone with Abadi, Iran s Rouhani voiced support for Iraq s national unity and territorial integrity, the state news agency IRNA reported.  Iran fully supports Iraq s central government,  Rouhani was quoted as telling Abadi. On Saturday, Turkey s parliament voted to extend by a year a mandate authorizing the deployment of Turkish troops in Iraq and Syria. Turkey has also vowed political, economic and security steps without specifying what they are, but Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim reinforced the message on Sunday. Turkey is the transit route of all crude exported by the landlocked Kurdistan region of Iraq.  Turkey will never ever tolerate any status change or any new formations on its southern borders,  he said in a speech in the capital Ankara.  The KRG will be primarily responsible for the probable developments after this referendum.  But Barzani said Ankara  won t benefit  economically should it close the border with Iraqi Kurdistan.  Tehran and Ankara fear the spread of separatism to their own Kurds. Iran also supports Shi ite groups who have been ruling or holding key security and government positions in Iraq since the U.S-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein. Barzani said Kurds will  keep extending their hand  to Iran and Turkey, even if they do not reciprocate. He said he recently met in the Kurdish region Iranian Revolutionary Guard Commander Qassem Soleimani, who came to convince him to delay the vote. The KRG has resisted calls to delay the referendum by the United Nations, the United States and Britain who fear it could     lead to unrest in disputed areas like multi-ethnic oil-rich Kirkuk, as well as distracting from the war on Islamic State. But the Iraqi Kurds say the vote acknowledges their crucial contribution in confronting Islamic State after it overwhelmed the Iraqi army in 2014 and seized control of a third of Iraq. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters who control Kirkuk were given instructions not to respond to any provocation meant to disrupt the vote, but they will defend the region if attacked from outside, he said. The U.S. embassy in Iraq warned its citizens that there might be unrest during the referendum, especially in disputed areas like Kirkuk, also claimed by the Iraqi central government. The Iranian military drills, part of annual events held in Iran to mark the beginning of the 1980-1988 war with Iraq, were launched in the Oshnavieh border region, according to Iranian State broadcaster IRIB. Turkey s military said on Sunday its aircraft launched strikes against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) targets in northern Iraq s Gara region on Saturday after spotting militants preparing to attack Turkish military outposts on the border.",worldnews,"September 24, 2017 ",1

The result was one of the most offensive news segments to ever grace Fox News, which is really saying something.Mother Jones reports:The segment, which opens with stereotypical Chinese music, is spliced with movie clips featuring Asian actors speaking in exaggerated accents. Watters approaches a number of men and women in the street, some of them elderly residents who do not speak English. He then silently mocks them for their inability to answer his questions many of which wander from the presidential race to lame caricatures of Asians masquerading as humor. Is food in China just food? Do you know karate? Things actually manage to go downhill when Watters makes it back to the studio for a sit-down with the show s host, Bill O Reilly. Yes. Things actually managed to get worse.O Reilly notes that the majority of the people interviewed seemed to have a good understanding of what is going on in American politics. Watters seemed stunned.

They won t walk away or tell me to get out of here. They just sit there and don t say nothing! It isn t hard to see why Republicans have been losing support among the Asian community.

12178,EU gives itself June deadline for deal on refugees,"European Union leaders appealed for unity in a last-ditch effort to break their deadlock on sharing out refugees by June, telling reluctant eastern states they could otherwise be outvoted on a dispute that has shaken the bloc s foundations. Coming out from a fraught discussion among 28 EU leaders that went into the small hours on Friday morning in Brussels, rivals in the two-year-old dispute all stuck to their guns, hemmed in by expectations they have raised with their own voters. The Mediterranean frontline states Italy and Greece, and the rich destination countries including Germany, Sweden, Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands are demanding that all countries host some refugees as a way to demonstrate solidarity. Their four ex-communist peers Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic refuse to accept people from the mostly-Muslim Middle East and North Africa, saying that would threaten their security after a raft of Islamic attacks in Europe.   There are areas where there is no solidarity and this is something I find unacceptable,  German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters. At one point during the two days of talks in Brussels, cameras caught Merkel, the bloc s paramount national leader, as she appeared to become agitated when talking with the leaders  chairman, Donald Tusk, making her displeasure with him clear. That came after Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland,  came out strongly against  ineffective  and  highly divisive  obligatory refugee quotas, ruffling the feathers of those states that back them as well as the executive European Commission.  The manner in which the principle of solidarity was being questioned does not only undermine the discussion on the refugee issue, but the future of Europe,  Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told reporters after what he called  intense  talks. Tusk said the ineffectiveness of relocation schemes was demonstrated by the fact that only 35,000 asylum seekers had been transferred from Greece and Italy under a 2015 plan meant to move 160,000 people.  Mandatory quotas remain a contentious issue,  Tusk told a joint news conference with the Commission s head Jean-Claude Juncker, the disagreement between the two playing out visibly despite their usually friendly rapport.  Relocation is not a solution to the issue of illegal migration.   Will a compromise be possible? It appears very hard. But we have to try our very best,  he said, stressing the bloc was in full agreement about making further efforts to tighten its borders and chip in for development and migration-related projects in the Middle East and Africa. After sealing a deal with Ankara in 2016 that cut off arrivals from Turkey to EU state Greece, the bloc is now pushing to stem African immigration to Italy through Libya.  Tusk, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and other leaders said they wanted to make permanent financing available for such activities in the bloc s next long-term budget from 2021. But it is the feud over how to share the burden of caring for those refugees who still make it to Europe that has weakened the bloc s cohesion and undermined member states  trust in each other at a time they need unity to face Brexit. After many months of letting the open wound fester, the backers of quotas made clear they want to move on and would vote on the broader reform of the bloc s asylum system by majority if no compromise acceptable for all is found by June on relocation.   I am not a fan of qualified majority decision-taking but... it can be used,  Juncker said.  Some of our colleagues were openly saying yesterday night that if there is no progress, they will propose qualified majority decision-making procedure.  That would inevitably deepen divisions in the EU and the four eastern states warned that the bloc would shoot itself in the foot should it go down this track.  The only proposal the EU has on the table on asylum reform has most recently been updated by Estonia and attempts to bridge the divide by proposing that any relocation of asylum-seekers from one EU state to another, while obligatory at times of extremely high arrivals, would in fact only take place if both involved agreed voluntarily to the terms. Diplomats in Brussels hoped Italy would be more willing to compromise after it holds elections, most likely in March, and said Germany could reassume the lead on the file after it forms a ruling coalition following an election last September. A senior EU diplomat from one of the pro-quota countries said they would seek to break the united front of the four eastern states to bring down the number of countries that would eventually be defeated in a vote if everything else fails.",worldnews,"December 14, 2017 ",0

Trump, one of the most successful businessmen of our time?After taking a stand for harmony and togetherness by wearing black sneaker and white sneakers with the word  Equality  written on them, to a game in Washington, DC, on Sunday night, NBA star LeBron James took a decidedly less conciliatory tone, in his post-game comments about President Trump.James said,  Obviously I ve been very outspoken and well-spoken about the situation that s going on at the helm here, and we re not going to let one person dictate us, us as Americans, how beautiful and how powerful we are as a people. It certainly was nice of James to add that he s been  well-spoken,  in addition to being outspoken.The three-time NBA champ and future Hall of Famer continued,  No matter the skin color, no matter the race, no matter who you are, I think we all have to understand that having equal rights and being able to stand for something and speak for something and keeping the conversation going. James did not elaborate on what rights he felt were in danger, nor did he explain exactly what  the conversation  was, or where it was going.However, James did speak from a place of unrivaled authority on the subject of being outspoken. In many ways, James has been the anti-Jordan, whereas MJ avoided political entanglements whenever possible, at least since 2012, James has embraced them whenever and wherever possible.James appeared in a photo with his teammates wearing hoodies in honor of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager shot to death by George Zimmerman in 2012. James wore an  I Can t Breathe  t-shirt to warm-ups at Madison Square Garden to show support for Eric Garner, a New York man who died after an altercation with police in 2014.The 13-time All-Star has also held nothing back when it comes to President Trump.

22646,BATTLE OVER PRIVACY: Why the FBI’s Case Against Apple is Falling Apart,"Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThis week a House Judiciary Committee began overseeing details of a US Federal Court case between tech company Apple and the FBI.On February 16th, Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly rejected a court order to decrypt an iPhone said to be connected to the San Bernardino mass-shooting case from December of 2015.The House Judiciary Committee listened to the controversial case between tech titan Apple and the FBI a day after Magistrate Judge James Orenstein of New York, struck down a federal court order pressuring Apple to help access encrypted data in a separate case involving illegal drug trafficking.The landmark decision made by Judge Orenstein stated that the All Writs Act of 1789 (also used as the FBI s main argument in the Apple/San Bernardino case) does not permit a court to order companies to pull encrypted data off a customer s phone or tablet,  according to a recent article from The Washington Post.The Post continued by discussing Orenstein s lengthy argument against the FBI s order against Apple in the drug related case: In a 50-page opinion disdainful of the government s arguments, Orenstein found that the All Writs Act does not apply in instances where Congress had the opportunity but failed to create an authority for the government to get the type of help it was seeking, such as having firms ensure they have a way to obtain data from encrypted phones. In addition, The Post outlined some of the social engineering aspects involved in the lead up to the FBI drug case overseen by Judge Orenstein, a case which has arguably been a part of an overarching back drop concerning the larger San Bernardino case: The Brooklyn case began last fall when Orenstein, one of a handful of magistrates across the country who are activists in the surveillance debate, received the government s application to issue an order to Apple. While Apple has previously helped the federal government with some 70 phone cases since 2008, Judge Orenstein examined several problems with the FBI s use of the All Writs Act: In an Oct. 9 ruling, Orenstein identified what he thought was a problem with the government s argument. Though prosecutors cited a 1985 decision that found that the All Writs Act is a source of authority to issue writs  not otherwise covered by statute,  he said they failed to cite another part of the decision that found that the act does not authorize the issuance of  ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate. The new ruling in the FBI drug case will likely have a heavy impact on the eventual ruling in the San Bernardino/Apple court order, as it directly questions the heart of the government s argument to gain easier access to encrypted consumer data.It s also interesting to note, that it was the FBI who put themselves in this position regarding the San Bernardino phone as they reportedly ordered the password to be reset via iCloud shortly after the apparent mass shooting.You have to wonder why the agency would have ordered a new password almost immediately following the highly dramatic scene in San Bernardino   INVENTIONS OF REALITY?    Is this latest  privacy crisis  a manufactured drama or a legitimate battle for those in the tech industry? (Photo illustration 21WIRE)What s interesting here, is that ABC news reported on December 3rd, a day after the apparent shooting,  Sources say mobile phones, hard drives, virtually anything with digital memory that was associated with the alleged shooters   Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik   was smashed. Adding to that, we ve mentioned a number of times here at 21WIRE, that none of the eyewitness testimony mentioned seeing a female shooter at the scene of the Inland Regional Center in the aftermath of the San Bernardino shooting.A Right to PrivacyIn our previous article detailing the ongoing encryption saga between Apple and the FBI, we stated that there are no guarantees in the security world, especially if a digital master-key were to be created, as this would potentially make it easier for invaders (either the government, or various hackers) mining for data moving forward into the future.In a recent Guardian article, some of those involved in the technology and security sector offered their thoughts regarding the government s continued encroachment on individual privacy:Dan Kaminsky, the security expert who made his name with the discovery that one of the most basic parts of the internet, the domain name system, was vulnerable to fraud   disagrees:  Feds want final authority on engineering decisions, and their interests don t even align with fighting the vast bulk of real-world crime. Kaminsky further explained why Apple s security measures already help law enforcement, If my iPhone is stolen, my emails stay unread, my photos stay unviewed, and I don t need to notify anyone that the secrets they entrusted me with are going to show up on the internet tomorrow. Continuing, The Guardian interviewed former FBI agent Michael German, currently at judicial think-tank the Brennan Center. The following is a portion of that interview: After 9/11, you had this concept of total information awareness. The intelligence community was very enamoured of the idea that all information was available. Much like the NSA, they wanted to see it all, collect it all, and analyse it all. Additionally, there are many who believe weaker encryption may pose an even bigger security risk globally.In many ways, it appears as though federal agencies are seemingly searching for the right crisis to push public opinion in favor of the state when it comes to security.This is at the core of the perpetual privacy and security battle post 9/11   TARGETING PRIVACY    FBI Director James Comey speaking at the Brookings Institution in October of 2014 about Going Dark. (Photo link brookings)Shining a Light on the FBI  Going Dark Last September, The Washington Post published an article entitled, Obama faces growing momentum to support widespread encryption,   and within its contents, perhaps the true nature of the security/privacy issue was laid bare (hat tip saperetic): Privately, law enforcement officials have acknowledged that prospects for congressional action this year are remote. Although  the legislative environment is very hostile today,  the intelligence community s top lawyer, Robert S. Litt, said to colleagues in an August e-mail, which was obtained by The Post,  it could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement. There is value, he said, in  keeping our options open for such a situation. Interestingly, in October of 2014, FBI Director James B. Comey, explained while speaking at the Brookings Institution he was  focused on trying to get the law changed  so that tech companies would have to comply with law enforcement to unlock data on various devices.Continuing, he outlined the current security agenda concerning the FBI,  We have the legal authority to intercept and access communications and information pursuant to a court order, but we often lack the technical ability to do that. The Brookings speech from 2014, appeared in stark contrast with a recent emotionally driven op-ed Comey wrote for Lawfare entitled  We Could Not Look the Survivors in the Eye if We Did Not Follow this Lead. Here s a passage from that piece, that clearly displays the conflicting message of the FBI director: We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist s passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That s it. We don t want to break anyone s encryption or set a master key loose on the land. The Guardian refers to this as a  two-pronged approach  on the public s senses   as one tone from the FBI comes across as caring and the other seems more focused on the greater, nationalistic implications of encryption.Think good cop/bad cop hovering over you in an interrogation room and you d be getting very warm.This is the kind of psychological drama that has prompted some in media to think that the law enforcement agency has been exploiting the public in the wake of tragedy, in order to increase security measures.This is absolutely something to watch.So, what are we to make of the FBI s claims of going dark in the digital age?It has long since been claimed that intelligence agencies fear going dark in the age of high-tech gadgetry. This idea is vastly overblown and not rooted in reality, especially when you consider the many revelations concerning NSA spying, collection of bulk metadata and other tracking programs such as the IMSI catcher, otherwise known as Stingray (Stingray acts as cell tower locking onto all devices in a certain area) intercepts phone calls, texts, as well as your location.The very notion that law enforcement will somehow be condemned eternally to outdated methods to catch criminals in the future   is patently absurd.Furthermore, the concept and presentation of the FBI s  going dark  scenario is nothing more than a talking point used to increase a police state apparatus within the United States.Don t PanicOn February 1st, a group of experts published report regarding the current status of law enforcement and their ability to keep up with the demands of crime solving in the world today. The lengthy report entitled  Don t Panic was compiled by The Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. Here s a passage below examining the FBI s catchy mantra,  Going Dark :The U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities view this trend with varying degrees of alarm, alleging that their interception capabilities are  going dark.  As they describe it, companies are increasingly adopting technological architectures that inhibit the government s ability to obtain access to communications, even in circumstances that satisfy the Fourth Amendment s warrant requirements. Encryption is the hallmark of these architectures. Government officials are concerned because, without access to communications, they fear they may not be able to prevent terrorist attacks and investigate and prosecute criminal activity. Their solution is to force companies to maintain access to user communications and data, and provide that access to law enforcement on demand, pursuant to the applicable legal process. However, the private sector has resisted. Critics fear that architectures geared to guarantee such access would compromise the security and privacy of users around the world, while also hurting the economic viability of U.S. companies. They also dispute the degree to which the proposed solutions would truly prevent terrorists and criminals from communicating in mediums resistant to surveillance.While the report states that encryption is a difficult issue for law enforcement, all sorts of digital data is unencrypted and therefore can be accessed via a search warrant if there is cause   not to mention the spying capabilities of a plethora of smart devices also available for review.Below is FBI Director (former Senior Vice President at Lockheed Martin) discussing the idea that the government is Going Dark In an article entitled  Here s Why the FBI Went After Apple When It Did,  Fortune magazine revealed that on February 9th, DOJ head Loretta Lynch requested  an extra $38 million to help the FBI development workarounds on data encryption, bringing the total budget of what it calls  project Going Dark  to $69 million. Will the FBI continue to develop  encryption workarounds  in the event that they lose their battle with Apple over the San Bernardino case?In Summary Regardless of how you shape the court battle between Apple and the FBI, this is about the government wanting a more direct route into personal devices moving ahead.For Apple, this is a very important issue as a dip in consumer confidence, could be a crushing blow to the tech company s overall brand.It s important to remember anomaly ridden events such as the San Bernardino shooting and the suspicious events in Garland, Texas, of last year, in addition to other inconvenient truths concerning the government s role in manufacturing its own terror plots   which have ironically prompted calls for greater national security, while continuing to appropriate large funds to federal agencies.You have to wonder, has the FBI s case against Apple fallen apart?READ MORE ENCRYPTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Encryption Files",US_News,"March 3, 2016",0

14701,South Korean says U.S. must not strike North Korea without Seoul's consent,"U.S. President Donald Trump should  under no circumstances  take military action against North Korea without the consent of the government in Seoul, the chairwoman of South Korea s ruling party, Choo Mi-ae, said on Wednesday.  President Trump often emphasizes that he put all options on the table,  Choo told a Washington think-tank.  We want to make sure that this option of another war is not placed on the table. Under no circumstances should the U.S. go ahead and use a military option without the consent of South Korea.   We must seek a peaceful resolution of the matter in any manner that is available to us.  The remarks by Choo, who is expected to meet Trump administration officials in Washington, underscored South Korean concerns that any U.S. strikes against North Korea s nuclear and missile programs could provoke devastating North Korean retaliation against South Korea. Visiting Seoul last week, Trump warned North Korea he was prepared to use the full range of U.S. military power to stop any attack, but also urged Pyongyang to  make a deal.  Trump, who had previously called negotiations with North Korea a waste of time, has offered no clear path to talks and has sent mixed signals about his interest in negotiations. Speaking on his return from Asia, Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping had rejected a  freeze for freeze  agreement. China and Russia have previously advocated such a plan, where the United States and South Korea stop major military exercises in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programs. It was not clear if this was what Trump meant.  We agreed that we would not accept a so-called  freeze for freeze  agreement like those that have consistently failed in the past,  Trump said. There was no immediate comment from China s embassy in Washington. Pyongyang has shown little interest in negotiations, at least until it has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. Choo, whose president and fellow Democratic Party leader Moon Jae-in has advocated dialogue with North Korea, said Seoul backed Trump s policy of maximum pressure on Pyongyang through sanctions and there should be no talks for the sake of talks. However, she said blocking opportunities for dialogue could prompt North Korean  miscalculation.  She declined to say whether she was satisfied with the Trump administration s limited efforts to talk to Pyongyang to resolve the crisis stemming from North Korea s efforts to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",1

7065,"More company climate votes ahead, as Trump may loosen energy rules","Activist shareholders plan a record number of resolutions focused on climate change at U.S. company annual meetings in 2017, even as President-elect Donald Trump looks set to loosen environmental regulations. Based on filings so far, U.S. companies are on track to face roughly 200 resolutions on climate matters at their shareholder meetings next year, according to Rob Berridge, who follows the subject for Ceres, a sustainability advocacy group.  There were 174 such resolutions this year, Berridge said, compared with 167 in 2015 and 148 in 2014. Many have been directed at big oil and gas companies, though other sectors have also been targeted, including technology and retail. Activist shareholders broadly aim to curb companies’ carbon emissions and make energy usage more efficient, or at the very least, to draw the attention of companies and investors to climate change as an urgent problem.  They have had some limited success. Investors at Exxon Mobil Corp the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer, passed a measure this year that could lead to an environmental activist joining its board. “Our position is that the risk of climate change is clear and warrants action,” said Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers. The rising number of shareholder votes reflects a growing concern among big investors about the environment, encouraged by steps by some boards to embrace reforms.  Deadlines are fast approaching to get resolutions on the ballot for shareholder meetings to be held in the spring. The election victory of Trump, who is set to take over as U.S. president on Jan. 20, only seems to have added impetus.  On the campaign trail, Trump dismissed human-caused climate change as a “hoax” and pledged to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency. He also threatened to withdraw the United States from the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change, although he appeared to step back from that position on Tuesday. He vowed instead to revive the U.S. coal industry, encourage oil drilling and to scale back regulation of the energy sector.  “Despite what the administration may or may not do, I really believe that corporations understand the risks posed by climate change,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a  California nonprofit campaign group. It sponsored 18 climate-related shareholder resolutions in 2016 and expects to file a bigger number next year. One resolution for 2017 calls on Anadarko Petroleum Corp to report on how it would address the risk of so-called stranded assets, such as high-cost deepwater project investments, that might be caused by a drop in demand for oil and gas. The idea won support from 42 percent of shares voted at the company’s 2016 meeting, up from 29 percent in 2015. Anadarko’s board last year called the idea “unnecessary and unproductive.” Spokesman John Christiansen said it is reviewing the proposal. To be sure, among S&P 500 companies, investor support for climate resolutions has been relatively weak, holding steady around 22 percent since 2014, according to research firm Fund Votes.  But activists often won more backing for ideas such as urging companies to report on their strategy for dealing with climate change, according to the Sustainable Investments Institute, a research firm specializing in shareholder votes, supported by universities, pension funds and other institutional investors.  Anne Simpson, director of sustainability for the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (Calpers), which manages about $300 billion, said it plans to file or back resolutions at U.S. oil and gas companies for 2017, though she declined to discuss specifics.  Last year the boards of mining companies including Rio Tinto Plc and Glencore Plc endorsed resolutions Calpers submitted calling for reports on climate risk, and the measures passed by wide margins.  More companies will likely embrace shareholder proposals to head off disruption caused by climate change, Simpson said. “Economics is driving this, not politics,” she said.",politicsNews,"November 25, 2016 ",0
10160,Sanders says party leaders may 'rethink' after wins,"Fresh from Democratic presidential primary wins over the weekend in three U.S. states, Bernie Sanders said on Sunday he had  political momentum that could help him win the backing of Democratic power brokers in his race against Hillary Clinton. Sanders easily won nominating contests in Alaska, Washington and Hawaii on Saturday. His latest remarks reflect his plan to chip away at Clinton’s commanding lead in the number of delegates needed to win the party’s nomination for the November election. Interviewed on Sunday by U.S. broadcasters, Sanders said Democratic “super-delegates,” who can change their allegiance, might face pressure to rally behind him because most polls suggest he has a better chance than Clinton of beating a Republican candidate. “Momentum is with us,” Sanders, a senator from Vermont, said on CNN’S State of the Union news program. “A lot of these super-delegates may rethink their position with Hillary Clinton.” Sanders also criticized Clinton’s reliance on wealthy donors to fund her campaign. He cited a fundraising dinner being hosted next month by actor George Clooney, where supporters will have to donate at least $33,400 to attend, or $353,400, nearly seven times the annual median income, if they want “premium” seating. “It is obscene that Secretary Clinton keeps going to big money people to fund her campaign,” Sanders told CNN. “Our events, we charge $15 or $50 for people to come.  So, it’s not a criticism of Clooney. It’s a criticism of a corrupt finance system.” About 85 percent of the votes at the July 25-28 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where a party nominee will be chosen to face the Republicans in the Nov. 8 election, are being determined by state nominating contests. The other 15 percent is held by party power brokers who are free to vote as they like, meaning they could hold the key in a tight contest. Super-delegates include party leaders and elected senators, members of the U.S. Congress and governors.  After Saturday’s contests, the former secretary of state led Sanders by just under 300 pledged delegates in the race for the 2,382 needed to be nominated.  Adding in the support of super-delegates, which the party created in the early 1980s to give leaders more control over the nominating process, Clinton had 1,712 delegates to 1,004 for Sanders, according to a tally by RealClearPolitics.com. The U.S. senator from Vermont needs to win up to two-thirds of the remaining delegates to catch Clinton, who will keep piling up delegates even when she loses under a Democratic Party system that awards them proportionally in all states.   Sanders is turning his attention to his native New York, where Democratic voters will divide up 247 delegates on April 19th. His campaign manager on Sunday wrote a letter to Clinton’s manager insisting that a planned televised debate between the candidates in April be held in the state, which Clinton represented as a U.S. senator for eight years. Jeff Weaver said in the letter that the Clinton campaign had resisted holding the debate in New York.   “Is the Secretary concerned about debating before the people who twice elected her to the U.S. Senate?” Weaver wrote. Spokesmen for Clinton did not respond to requests for comment.",politicsNews,"March 27, 2016 ",0
2707,U.S. House panel to consider self-driving car legislation,"A U.S. House subcommittee will vote on Wednesday on a sweeping proposal to allow automakers to deploy up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards and bar states from imposing driverless car rules. The measure, which would be the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to U.S. regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. Automakers would have to show self-driving cars “function as intended and contain fail safe features” but the Transportation Department could not “condition deployment or testing of highly automated vehicles on review of safety assessment certifications,” the draft measure unveiled late Monday said. Last month, a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing on a draft plan to allow U.S. regulators to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles a year per manufacturer from federal motor vehicle safety rules that prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls and bar states from setting rules that could block their use. Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. The 30-page draft bill would also require the Transportation Department within two years to adopt rules requiring automakers to add a driver alert to check rear seating in an effort to prevent children from being left behind and consider setting performance standards for headlights. “This legislation puts important benchmarks into place that will prioritize consumer safety technologies and enhance mobility opportunities for people across the country,” said Republican U.S. Representative Robert Latta, who chairs the panel that will vote on the measure Wednesday. Democrats had sought a number of new safety requirements during negotiations over the measure. The bill also includes automakers to take steps to ensure the cybersecurity of self-driving cars. General Motors Co, Alphabet Inc, Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards, under the proposal. The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars that asked automakers to submit a 15-question safety assessment. President Donald Trump’s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said she plans to update those in the coming months. The issue has taken new urgency after U.S. road deaths rose 7.7 percent in 2015 over the previous year to 35,200, the highest annual jump since 1966. Traffic deaths climbed nearly 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, government data shows. Automakers also say that without changes in regulations, U.S. self-driving car testing could move to Europe and elsewhere.",politicsNews,"July 18, 2017 ",0
19411,Exclusive: Turkey to deploy troops inside Syria's Idlib - Erdogan,"Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday Turkey will deploy troops in Syria s northern Idlib region as part of a so-called de-escalation agreement brokered by Russia last month. The  de-escalation  zones, agreed by Turkey, Russia and Iran, would be further discussed in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his trip to Ankara next week, Erdogan said in an interview with Reuters while he was in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly.  Under the agreement, Russians are maintaining security outside Idlib and Turkey will maintain the security inside Idlib region,  Erdogan said.  The task is not easy ... With Putin we will discuss additional steps needed to be taken in order to eradicate terrorists once and for all to restore peace.  Erdogan also said Turkey was considering counter-measures, including imposing sanctions, against Kurdish northern Iraq over a planned referendum. Iraqi Kurdish authorities have defied growing international pressure to call off the referendum on independence. Iraq s neighbors fear it will fuel unrest among their own Kurdish populations and Western allies said it could detract from the fight against Islamic State. Turkey has brought forward a cabinet meeting and national security council session to Friday over the referendum, Erdogan said. He said that parliament would also convene for an extraordinary meeting on Saturday.  Without any further delay we are going to discuss what kind of sanctions should be imposed and when the sanctions will be imposed,  he said without elaborating on what they might be.     Turkish troops are also carrying out military exercises near the border and Erdogan said on Saturday the resolution on troop deployment abroad will be submitted to parliament for a vote.   Erdogan called on the United States to extradite U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan accuses of orchestrating a failed coup attempt in Turkey, in which rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and fighter jets, bombing parliament and trying to abduct or kill Erdogan. Gulen denies any involvement in the July 2016 coup attempt, during which more than 240 people were killed.  Gulen s entire network is being run from the United States. Terrorists should not be harbored here. We need U.S. assistance on this matter,  Erdogan said. Since the failed coup, Turkish authorities have shut more than 130 media outlets and a press union says more than 150 journalists have been jailed, raising concerns about media freedom in Turkey. Turkey has also suspended or dismissed more than 150,000 judges, teachers, police and civil servants and has arrested nearly 50,000 others suspected of links to the Gulen movement. The EU and human rights organizations have expressed concern over Turkey s security crackdown since the failed coup.  Turkey says its crackdown is targeting supporters of Gulen.          Let me be very clear, in terms of freedom of press, there are no challenges in Turkey ... If journalists are supporters of terrorists, if they are double-agents, are we not supposed to do what is necessary against them?  Erdogan said.  Turkey is a state of law, within which the judiciary takes necessary measure ... This is sheer lie ... they were coup plotters.  Meeting Erdogan on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday praised his leadership and said he  has become a friend of mine.  Relations between Turkey and the United States were strained over Turkish security officials involved in street fighting with protesters during a visit to Washington in May. Turkey is part of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq but Ankara s ties with Washington are strained over support provided by the United States to the Syrian Kurdish militia YPG. Viewed by Turkey as the Syrian extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the YPG has been among the most effective partners on the ground in the U.S.-led fight against the Islamic State. Erdogan warned Washington that arming the YPG could end up hurting Washington and its allies.   Weapons are being deployed to YPG ... We are strategic allies with the United States ..., we should avoid helping YPG,  he said. At a critical time for Turkish-Germany relations, Erdogan said in the interview he hoped relations with Germany could be improved, praising German Chancellor Angela Merkel for refraining from criticizing Turkey and its policies.  I am quite hopeful relations will improve ... We have no problem with the German public. We have a problem with some officials  wrong attitude against Turkey,  he said. Merkel, who has been at odds with Erdogan on many fronts over the last year, has said that  the fact is clear that Turkey should not become a member of the EU . Merkel has said she will speak to other European Union leaders to end Turkey s EU accession talks.  Things never went well for the last 54 years regarding Turkey s EU membership ... We have been lingering at the doorstep of the EU and things have got worse. They have never kept their promises,  Erdogan said.",worldnews,"September 21, 2017 ",0

1729,Trump says violence by anti-fascists proves him right on Charlottesville,"President Donald Trump on Thursday stood by his belief that both sides were to blame for violence in Charlottesville, Virginia,  between white supremacists and counterprotesters last month. Trump had drawn criticism for not initially condemning white supremacists who organized the event on Aug. 12, with even some of his fellow Republicans expressing dismay at his opinion.  Trump spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One a day after a meeting with South Carolina Republican Senator Tim Scott, an African-American who had expressed concern about Trump’s comments. “We had a great talk yesterday,” he said of his meeting with Scott. “I think especially in the light of the advent of antifa, if you look at what’s going on there. You have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also. And essentially that’s what I said.” Trump said anti-fascist groups known as the “antifa” must share blame for neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan fighting with anti-racism protesters in the streets. One woman was killed when a suspected white nationalist crashed his car into demonstrators. On Thursday, the president also signed a resolution sent to him by Congress that condemned the violence in Charlottesville and opposed “hatred, bigotry, and racism in all forms.” “No matter the color of our skin or our ethnic heritage, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God,” Trump said in a statement regarding the resolution.   In Berkeley, California, violence erupted on Aug. 27 when a small group of masked antifa and left-wing protestors attacked right-wing demonstrators.     “Now, because of what’s happened since then with antifa, you look at really what’s happened since Charlottesville. A lot of people are saying, in fact a lot of people have actually written, ‘Gee, Trump might have a point,’” he said.",politicsNews,"September 14, 2017 ",1
4986,"Fmr. Romney Campaign Chair Breaks Ranks, Gives Full-Throated Endorsement Of Clinton","Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been openly critical of Donald Trump, and of the Republican Party s continued support of the bombastic billionaire for president. Now, one of his former campaign operatives has written a stunning op-ed in which he roundly trashed Donald Trump and gave a rather glowing endorsement of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. That man is David Nierenberg, Romney s former finance chair. The piece appeared on CNBC s website. Nierenberg says of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton knows her stuff. She is emotionally mature and centered. She respects and enjoys working with people from all backgrounds.She has the diplomatic skills needed to break the gridlock in Washington and lead our country well. America needs a steady hand on the tiller. Despite being a Republican with ties to Mitt Romney dating back to 2006, Nierenberg had this to say about his party s current standard-bearer: Trump is the most dangerous major party presidential candidate in my lifetime, maybe in American history. His character, temperament and behavior are definitely not presidential.I don t think he s fit to be our president. He speaks positively about foreign dictators and acts like one himself.This year, however, watching and listening to Donald Trump s erratic daily bullying, ranting, bragging, scapegoating and name-calling, my conscience and my three adult children will not let me vote for him. Nierenberg also joined the call for Trump to release his tax returns. He said: For decades, candidates, including successful business people, have released their tax returns; why does Trump think he shouldn t follow the rules of the game? Defeating him has to be our national priority. He is exactly right. This is a time to put party before country. This is no longer about left versus right, Republicans versus Democrats. This is about having one candidate in what is, for all intents and purposes, a two-party political system who is qualified versus one who is a dangerously unfit demagogue. The choice is ours, America. Put party before country and vote blue in November.Featured image via Instagram",News,"August 19, 2016",1
17221,"Chaotic response to Somali bombing cost lives, medics say","Medics who rushed to help victims of a huge bomb explosion in the Somali capital Mogadishu that killed more than 300 people say the country s threadbare emergency services have been pushed beyond their limit.  From a lack of ambulance drivers to break-downs of the ambulances themselves, to checkpoints blocking routes to hospitals to a shortage of blood, the chaotic response to the deadliest truck bombing in Somalia s history cost additional lives, they said.  Officials say that Saturday s bombing, which also wounded at least 400 people, bore the hallmarks of the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab, but the group has not claimed responsibility. More than three days after the bombing at a busy intersection in the capital, hundreds of people were still searching for relatives in hospitals and trying to access the blast site, Reuters witnesses said. Dr Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Aamin Ambulances, a privately-funded ambulance service responding to the attack, described the limitations of his country s emergency system.  We have old ambulances and after working 24 hours for days, three broke down. The telephones got jammed and we had no walkie talkies.  He said road blocks manned by the security forces delayed ambulances, and there were not enough medics to respond to the devastating attack. Somalia has been mired in conflict since 1991, when clan warlords overthrew a dictator and then turned on each other. One of the poorest countries in Africa, it faces severe food insecurity and relies on foreign donors to support its institutions and basic services. One ambulance driver said security forces badly hampered efforts at the blast site and even fired at vehicles.  Ambulance driver Mohamed Saiid told Reuters:  I could see people screaming in a burning public vehicle and police opened fire refusing [help] that could save them.    When you want to save a screaming casualty but a soldier denies you access at gun point ... it is a tough work,  he said.  Such delays caused  many injured people to die from blood loss,  he said.  Another ambulance driver said police stopped him entering the blast scene.  I was stopped by forces at gunpoint as I was just some meters away from the blast scene,  said Mohamed Howle, a driver from a hospital in the city.  A spokesman for Mogadishu s mayor said safety was the top priority in the response and there was no delay in rescuing injured people. Spokesman Abdifatah Omar Halane said some injured people may have died while being carried from the scene:  No one can save the lives of someone whose brain mucus was oozing.  Police officer Mohamed Hussein told Reuters he was at the blast site several times daily since the bombing and ambulances were not fired upon.  Soldiers often fire in the air in the city to clear traffic jams, he said, suggesting that guns may have been discharged by security forces to establish order. Information Minister Abdirahman Omar Osman earlier said Somalia does not have a blood bank. But doctors said the public had responded quickly to calls for blood donations. Countries including Turkey, Qatar and Kenya were providing medical assistance and evacuating wounded.  We are requesting blood. We are requesting assistance for verifying the dead in order for their relatives to know,  the minister said. Osman said the bodies of more than 100 people buried on Monday  were blown beyond recognition . He hoped other bodies could still be identified. Mohamed Nur, head of the emergency unit at Medina hospital in Mogadishu said on Tuesday that doctors and nurses were working around the clock and the number of casualties had overwhelmed the hospital.          Turkish doctors, mainly surgeons and specialists in spine injuries, arrived along with Turkey s health minister on Monday and were still treating injured in local hospitals, the minister said. Turkey evacuated 35 critically wounded Somalis to Ankara by plane on Monday, Turkish deputy prime minister Recep Akdag told reporters on returning from Somalia. An increasingly close ally of Somalia, Turkey opened a $50 million military base in the capital last month.  Medicine from neighboring nations Djibouti and Kenya arrived by plane on Tuesday, the minister said. Qatar sent a plane with medical equipment and planned to evacuate injured people for treatment outside Somalia, Qatar s state news agency reported.",worldnews,"October 17, 2017 ",1

And he joked that he and his staff were too tired to run for a third term, even if he could.At another fundraiser, Obama pointed out that getting Democrats back in charge of Congress is very important.On Thursday night, Obama attended a large gathering at the Bel Air mansion of Disney Chairman Alan Horn and his environmentalist wife, Cindy. There, the president stressed the importance of  recognizing the enormous power of Congress and the difference between a Nancy Pelosi being Speaker of the House and a Paul Ryan being Speaker of the House. The President also highlighted the GOP blockade of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, even though Garland has received praise from across the political spectrum. And he pointed out that the blockade would be eroded with more Democratic votes in the Senate since,  What we ve seen out of the Republicans in the Senate is not simply a refusal to confirm him thus far, but a refusal to meet with him or to have a hearing, or to have a vote. Obama went on to point out that crazed statements from Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have also helped to expose some of the extremism that happens every day in the House and Senate from Republicans, saying,  People act as if these folks are outliers. But they re not. The President said widespread coverage of their speeches and statements could help to motivate voters.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 8, 2016",0
19204,From nursery to university: Emerging market investors buy into education,"Two decades after Yusuf Karodia launched Mancosa, a distance learning school to teach South Africans business skills, he sold up to UK private equity firm Actis. From nurseries to exam tutoring and adult education, teaching businesses are booming as populations rise and cash-strapped governments fail to keep up with demand.  With 263 million children out of school worldwide, according to 2014 data from the United Nations, investors are keen to access a growing sector with few publicly-listed companies.  Karodia said Actis was one of a stream of interested private investors.    We had about an overture a week to partner with someone,  he told Reuters. Mancosa is now part of Actis s expanding higher education portfolio in Africa. It has spent $275 million since 2014, investing in education institutes across the continent which it groups under the brand name Honoris Universities and plans to list on a stock market in the next two to three years. Karodia, who will also get a stake in Honoris, says there is huge demand for education in Africa.    Quality education - especially coming from the private sector - is going to play an ever increasingly important role,  he said.  The International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity estimates that international financing for education in low- and middle-income countries will need to increase from today s estimated $16 billion per year to $89 billion by 2030. Jetilde Carlos is a 22-year old final year finance student at the Varsity College in Cape Town, owned by Johannesburg-listed ADvTECH Group. Carlos missed out on a place at a state university.  Its not that my parents had the money but they really wanted a better life for me. They didn t want me to sit at home looking for job when I might not even find one,  she said.  The degree is worth it in the end        Investors are keen for a slice of the market because the fee-paying structure guarantees a regular income stream. The sector is also relatively resilient to economic ups and downs as parents increasingly prioritize their children s education.   It goes with the whole consumer spending (trend) in emerging markets, and as income levels rise and there is more disposable income available what you re seeing is the population is looking to spend in areas such as education,  said Patricia Ribeiro, an equity portfolio manager at American Century Investments. Carlos paid a deposit of 25,000 rand ($1,876.38). If you pay up front the total is 70,500 rand but the monthly payments that she has chosen bring the total to about 90,000 rand for one year s tuition.  The sector is dominated by private equity players. MSCI s emerging equity index contains only three education stocks - New York-listed Chinese firms TAL and New Oriental Education and Brazil s Kroton.  Morgan Stanley describes shares in Chinese education operators as  attractive . China s education market catering for children from nursery to end of secondary school will grow 8 percent annually to become a 3 trillion yuan ($460 billion) market in 2020, the bank told clients.  Recent regulatory changes are set to benefit private tutoring firms, many of which prepare high-school pupils for university. TAL said in July that student enrolment was up more than 60 percent year-on-year, with a matching rise in revenue. Its stock has soared 180 percent since January. New Oriental Education projects revenue growth of as much as 24 percent in the three months to end-August. Its shares are up 114 percent since the start of 2017.  China is very exam-driven from kindergarten on and they are competing more and more with U.S. schools,  said Sandra Ackermann-Schaufler, senior portfolio manager for emerging markets at SEI.  If anyone thinks it s tough to get into U.S. universities they should look at the top Chinese universities....the growth you could see is explosive growth.  Valuations are soaring, possibly because fund managers are chasing too few companies. TAL s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is nearly 130, while New Oriental Education hovers around 50. In contrast, MSCI s emerging equity index trades at a P/E of around 12.   If you look at PE historically or if you look at PE this year, they look very expensive,  Julian Mayo, portfolio manager at Charlemagne Capital. Brazil became another destination for those seeking exposure to education stocks after 2009 when the government boosted loan programs for students attending for-profit colleges.  One of the main beneficiaries was Brazil s largest for-profit college operator Kroton Educacional.  While the recent recession in Latin America s biggest economy led to a fall in student loans, the biggest companies are already well-established, fund managers said.  Results published last month showed revenue growing near double-digits on the quarter, with gross margins well above 70 percent. Kroton s stock has risen more than 50 percent since the start of the year. The Gulf region also offers opportunities. Kuwait-based HumanSoft, which establishes and manages private universities and colleges listed in 2005.   United Arab Emirates-based GEMS Education, which operates more than 250 schools across 14 countries and counts Blackstone among its stakeholders, has indicated plans to list. In Africa, many governments want more private investors in education but they are approaching it cautiously. They want regulations in place to ensure the quality is high. Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi, Minister of International Affairs and Cooperation in Botswana said some young people had left private universities with certificates that  opened no doors . She said it was difficult to make sure  the people who are investing in education are not fraudsters, what we are finding is that some people are not there to deliver quality education.    We learned this very badly ourselves... but now people come in and invest, and this is taking a huge load off the government,  she said.",worldnews,"September 24, 2017 ",1
11044,47 FABULOUS PHOTOS Of Melania Trump On Her 47th Birthday,"Melanija Knavs-Trump was born on April 26, 1970 in the small Slovenian railroad town of Sevnica.Her father Victor was a car parts salesman. He drove a Mercedes, and by the time young Melania was 16 he had built the house in the small town of Sevnica   population 4,500   as a weekend retreat for the family. The property is on the banks of the River Sava.Meanwhile, Melania s mother Amalija worked as an executive in a textile factory. She would come back from business trips to Milan and Paris with tales that would inspire her daughter to make her name in international fashion   first as a designer before embarking on the modeling career that would lead to her meeting Donald Trump.School friends remember Melania as a studious girl who preferred her books to playing   a long way from the woman who would pose for photos in a magazine wearing the skimpiest outfits aboard  Trump Force One    her husband s customised Boeing 727 (which he has since upgraded to a 757).Her childhood neighbour and friend Mirjana Jelancic, 45, who is now the headteacher at the primary school in Slovenia which they both attended, said:  She loved everything to do with art and design. She would renovate old things to make them like new, such as old baskets. Her family put them in the living room with flowers in. Ms Jelancic said that Melania, now 46, often showed off her diplomatic skills by acting as a mediator during playground disputes. She said:  She had a strong personality. She would not be the first with an opinion, but she was intelligent and wise. She grew up in a society when there was not so much freedom. She knew that there was a bigger world out there because her mother had gone to fashion shows as part of her work. She wanted something more from life, but she never told me that she wanted to be a model. She liked knitting and making clothes. In those times, people were more or less equal, but her family had a sense of aesthetics. Her father always had a Mercedes and it was a ritual that Melania and her sister Ines would clean it every Saturday.  She was always reading books, fashion magazines and catalogues. Kids would often call her to play, but she was busy reading. Melania, her parents and sister moved to an apartment in Slovenia s capital, Ljubljana, when she was about 14, and she started at the city s Secondary School of Design and Photography.But her family retained their links with Sevnica, building their own white-painted house with a balcony and staying there at weekends.Her parents, who have lived in New York in recent years, still own the house and return once or twice a year. It even has a US-style mailbox. The couple were last there for a week in June when neighbors noticed they had bodyguards.  DMMelania was 16 when she was spotted by fashion photographer Stane Jerko in Ljubljana and he invited her to pose for him. He said:  I saw this tall girl with long hair and long legs so immediately introduced myself. She was a little self-conscious when I first photographed her, but she learned very quickly and relaxed. Melania s first modeling job was for Vezenine Bled one of the most prominent textile factories in Yugoslavia. That was about two years before the country fell apart in a series of bloody wars. Nowadays, the Vezenine Bled factory grounds function as a paintball site. She was very interested in perfecting her pose for the camera and in what kind of lighting worked best,  Jerko says.  She was eager to learn what it took to make a great photograph. It didn t take long for Melania to start getting regular modeling jobs, so Jerko didn t see much of her from then on.  I would be delighted if she became first lady,  he says.  She didn t get there because I discovered her she has worked on herself a lot. She never went out with us, the local fashion crowd. She always had her books with her. She was always swimming or studying. She knew what she wanted.

9661,North Carolina lawmaker dismisses U.S. deadline to change bathroom law,"SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Republican leaders in North Carolina on Thursday refused to back down from a law regulating which restrooms can be used by transgender people after the federal government told the state the law violated the U.S. Civil Rights Act.  The state’s leading Republican lawmaker, House Speaker Tim Moore, told reporters in Raleigh that North Carolina would not be “bullied” into meeting the U.S. Justice Department’s Monday deadline to change the law. North Carolina is the first U.S. state to pass a law requiring transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate instead of the gender with which they identify.  Republican legislators in several other states have proposed similar laws, making transgender rights a hot-button social issue in an election year. The Justice Department’s challenge is similarly unprecedented, though the agency has in the past intervened on behalf of transgender individuals who have alleged discrimination. The Republican National Committee urged state legislators in January to resist federal policies that allow transgender people to use restrooms of their choice at public schools. The Justice Department said in letters to North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory and other state officials on Wednesday that the state had until Monday to decided if it would stop discriminating against transgender state employees. McCrory affirmed his support for the “very common-sense rule” before a group of business leaders on Wednesday night but said he did not know if the state would fight the Justice Department. His office did not respond to questions on Thursday. If McCrory does not stand down from enforcing the law, the Justice Department’s civil rights division could push for a court order. If a federal judge sides with the agency, North Carolina would have to comply or face a reduction in federal funding.  On Thursday, Republican Senate leader Phil Berger’s spokeswoman, Amy Auth, said state lawyers were reviewing the letter. Berger on Wednesday said the department’s position represented “a gross overreach.”  North Carolina’s Secretary of Public Safety and officials at the University of North Carolina also received similar letters on Wednesday. Margaret Spellings, president of the University of North Carolina system, said her office would respond to the department’s letter by the deadline. “We take this determination seriously and will be conferring with the Governor’s Office, legislative leaders, and counsel about next steps,” she said. Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson would not say whether the department would take legal action against the state.  The state law is being challenged in federal court by critics including the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal, which advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. “We’ve never before seen a state do something as aggressive as require mandatory discrimination against its own transgender employees,” said Peter Renn, an attorney with Lambda Legal, in a phone interview with Reuters.  Jillian Weiss, an attorney who has argued in federal court for transgender rights, said the Justice Department’s action against North Carolina showed the federal government was willing to intervene when states passed laws reducing rights based on gender identity and sexual orientation.  Weiss predicts Mississippi, where a law allowing businesses to refuse service to gay people takes effect in July, will be the department’s next target.",politicsNews,"May 5, 2016 ",0

8253,Fox News And Rudy Giuliani Fully Brought Out Their White Hoods To Attack Beyoncé (VIDEO),"How does the saying go? Fox News: Not racist, but number one with racists. Actually, no, they are pretty damn racist. And proof of this can be seen on Fox & Friends, when they decided to talk about the Super Bowl halftime show and Beyonc s performance.According to Fox News and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Beyonc  wasn t  wholesome  enough for them, and she bashed police officers. You know, because god forbid as an African-American artist Beyonc  speak of the ever-present reality of police brutality that has become an epidemic in the nation for people of color. And instead of seeing her performance as something that can bring people together to tackle hate, Giuliani saw it as a tribute to the Black Panthers.Brian Kilmeade said: I couldn t really make out what Beyonc  was saying. But at the end, we find out Beyonc  dressed up in a tribute to the Black Panthers, went to a Malcolm X formation. And the song, the lyrics, which I couldn t make out a syllable, were basically telling cops to stop shooting blacks!

It is a national epidemic that is obvious to anyone who isn t a raging racist.Giuliani chimed in with: I think it was outrageous. The halftime show I thought was ridiculous anyway, I don t know what the heck it was. A bunch of people like bouncing around and doing strange things. I actually don t even know why we have this. I thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers, who are the people who protect her. What we should be doing in the African-American community and all communities is build up respect for police officers. He apparently doesn t see that, while yes, police officers should be respected, many of these officers need to also respect the citizens they are paid to serve and protect.The former mayor continued: This is a political position and she s probably going to take advantage of it. You re talking to middle America when you have the Super Bowl. So if you re going to have entertainment, let s have decent, wholesome entertainment. And not use it as a platform to attack the people who put their lives at risk just to save us. Yes, let s not ever make people think about things. Let s keep things clean and under cover, like apparently this entire couch when they are wearing their white sheets at the local Klan meeting. What the actual fuck? They are being racist, at this point, to just be racist.

4684,Instant View: Republicans pull Obamacare repeal bill,"Republican leaders of the House of Representatives pulled legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system from consideration on Friday due to a shortage of votes, despite desperate lobbying by the White House and its allies in Congress, dealing a stiff setback to President Donald Trump. DANIEL MORGAN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SYNOVUS TRUST COMPANY, ATLANTA, GEORGIA: “There’s a bit of a relief rally. There were worries going into it... but it’s a mixed bag. “It does now open the door for maybe they table the whole thing and just move on, and I would think the next thing on the docket would have to be tax reform. The market, to me, is more interested in tax reform than it is in changing Obamacare. “In a way, for me, sitting on $600 million worth of investments, I think it’s great. Let’s move and get into tax reform, and then get into the infrastructure bill.” PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: “The market is relieved it’s not going to go down to a defeat, and it’s hopeful they’ll come to some sort of agreement over the weekend. The market is hoping for an agreement as a stepping stone to additional agreements.” “News report suggested that the likely outcome was they were going to lose. I would think the expectations are that they’re pulling it so they can work on it.” “The last few days, market has sort of traded on the back foot on anticipation of the vote that would happen at some point this week. Generally, risk sentiment has been undermined off of that, especially with this steady drip of news that indicated lacking support for the bill. And now, I think, it sort of lifted that uncertainty, at least temporarily, for the rest of the day. Maybe just lifting the uncertainty premium has markets breathing a sigh of relief for now.” PARESH UPADHYAYA, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, PIONEER INVESTMENTS, BOSTON: “The initial market interpretation is a positive sign. It seems like it is taking that Trump wants to instead of sinking it, he wants to give it another shot. It seems like they think he is working to get something on his agenda to be passed by Congress. Or perhaps it’s a sign that if healthcare reform is shelved, Trump will focus on tax reform. It’s more a knee jerk reaction.  “There are still a lot of hard questions regardless to tax reform. He can’t force people to change their vote on social media. Good old fashion politicking is needed to build consensus.  “If this stronger dollar has legs, it depends on the next step. If there is a pivot to taxes from healthcare, the market has to see the plan.” RAHUL SHAH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, IDEAL ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: “From an investor viewpoint, it shows that Trump will not be able to easily pass his agenda. That being said, healthcare is more difficult to pass than tax cuts and the infrastructure bill that he’s proposing. “In one sense that’s a negative, but on the other hand it also might give some relief to investors who are concerned about some of Trump’s more controversial proposals like increased tariffs and a border adjustment tax.  “You could see this as a glass half empty or a glass half-full, gridlock is not something that’s unheard of on Wall Street, so I think stocks should be OK going forward.” “I think the most important thing is that this changes the perception of the relationship between Trump and Congress. For the last few months the assumption has been that Congress would do whatever the Trump plan called for, and that apparently is not going to be the case.” PETER KENNY, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, GLOBAL MARKETS ADVISORY GROUP, NEW YORK: “I don’t think it’s going to have a huge impact on equities, although it may have more of an impact on biotech and healthcare.  “This is now an indication that the president’s agenda is probably going to be more ambitious than Congress can manage. It is probably going to mean that equity markets are going to have to factor in a degree of dysfunction that investors were hoping they wouldn’t have to. Which means it will likely have a muted impact on equity performance moving forward.  “There is very little on the horizon as of right now, as a result of this thing being pulled, that is going to fuel a significant move higher in prices. This is largely going to homogenize any sort of volatility moving forward and is probably going to be a cap on any near-term performance in terms of the upside. “The fact this bill, which the President has said flat-out he will make it work for all Americans in general, can’t pass is an indication this agenda is going to be more ambitious than this Congress can work with. This doesn’t even include the Democrats. It is not just divided between Democrats and Republicans, it is divided between progressives, Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians. It is an indication that investors should not expect the kind of velocity in terms of agenda accomplishments they were expecting when he was elected.” MARGARET PATEL, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WELLS FARGO ASSET MANAGEMENT, BOSTON: “It looked like the market was worried that the Trump agenda would get completely bogged down in the healthcare issue, and now that they’ve taken the healthcare issue off the table, I think the market is more optimistic that they can do other things that are more doable that are not so complicated, such as regulatory reform and lowering taxes. It does seem like a positive move to shelve an issue that’s so complex and very expensive no matter what the plan, move on to something that is a little bit easier, which would be lowering taxes.” BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO: “It didn’t pass and it didn’t fail so any conjecture about the ultimate meaning is premature. President Trump is getting a lesson in varsity Washington politics.” STOCKS: S&P 500 pares losses to end session down fractionally; Dow ends down 0.29 percent; Nasdaq ends up 0.19 percent BONDS: 2- and 10-year Treasury yields rise from session lows FOREX: The dollar index edges up by gains against the euro and yen",politicsNews,"March 24, 2017 ",0
19989,YOUR BLOOD WILL BOIL When You See Why College Students Were Forced To Stand Guard Over Thousands Of U.S. FLAGS Meant To Honor 9-11 Victims On Their Liberal Campus,"This is how coddled kids who have never had to deal with losing an innocent family member, friend or co-worker at the hands of evil Islamic terrorists behaves At Occidental College on Saturday, vandals trashed 2,977 U.S. flags planted in the quad to memorialize those who died on Sept. 11.The students who planted the small American flags found them uprooted and thrown in campus garbage cans. Every last flag. Some were even snapped in half.Not only that, dozens of makeshift fliers accompanied the vandalism. Taped to benches and other surfaces, most of the fliers stated  R.I.P.  to 9/11 victims as well as to 1.45 million Iraqis who died  during the U.S. invasion for something they didn t do. Sophomore Alan Bliss, a math and economics major who helped lead the effort to plant the flags, told The College Fix in a telephone interview Sunday that when he and a friend came across the destroyed memorial, three students confronted him and said they found the display  triggering.  He said the students also accused him of white privilege and ignorance.Occidental is a small liberal-arts college in Los Angeles known as far-left. President Barack Obama attended for two years before transferring to Columbia. So when the right or even moderates try to do something on campus there is extreme push back,  Bliss said of his school, adding conservatives are a  silent majority  there and some students are even scared of speaking up against progressives for fear of retribution.As for the display, Bliss said it was installed Saturday afternoon by his conservative student club, which is affiliated with the College Republican National Committee and Young Americans for Freedom, the latter of which helped sponsor the  Never Forget  memorial project.Later that night Bliss said he learned bandits had uprooted and tossed the flags. When Bliss and his friend arrived at the scene, it was 12:30 a.m. Sunday morning. The three students who told Bliss the display is triggering denied involvement in the vandalism, he said.Campus safety was called and officers took statements from Bliss as well as the other three students.Meanwhile, Bliss added, as word spread on social media that the  Never Forget  memorial was razed, students left their dorm rooms in the middle of the night to help replant the flags. As students came home from parties, they chipped in, too. They were just like,  I am not Republican, I am not conservative, but this is a terrible act,  Bliss said.  They stayed there late into the night, 2 a.m., planting flags. It was pretty amazing, it was pretty touching. A Facebook post from the club offers more details on the long evening:  Later that morning, a few of us stood guard at the memorial. Four Occidental students came up and snapped a few flags right in our faces. When we confronted them, those cowards got away as fast as they possibly could. When Bliss (pictured) and his friends returned to the display after breakfast Sunday morning, he said he found another 100 flags trashed. And again, Bliss and his peers replanted.Bliss, 20, co-founder and president of the club, which he alanblisslaunched in the spring of 2016, said he plans to fight back.

8325,Trade critic Trump visits Boeing Co's backyard,"Republican Donald Trump, who has made his criticism of a pending Pacific trade agreement central to his campaign, on Tuesday visited a Seattle suburb home to a large Boeing Co plane manufacturing facility that depends heavily on Asian sales. Trump vowed at his rally that he would win Washington state, even though the state tends to support Democrats and that party’s nominee, Hillary Clinton, leads by large margins in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election. The Republican nominee, however, presents a conundrum for the unions that represent workers at Boeing, the world’s largest aerospace company. He has courted manufacturing workers with vows to tear up trade agreements and scrap the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership.  “The destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved,” Trump said on Tuesday, referring to a separate deal with Canada and Mexico reached in the 1990s. He also has vowed to renegotiate that agreement. Supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) point to Boeing’s aircraft sales to Asia to tout the benefits of the agreement. Secretary of State John Kerry visited a nearby plant earlier this year to rally support for the pact. Manufacturing unions agree with Trump on his opposition to TPP and the export of jobs overseas, but officials said they find his track record unconvincing. “The fact is that Trump has had the opportunity to bring jobs to Americans, and he’s chosen to outsource them,” said Larry Brown, legislative and political director for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge 751, which represents about 32,000 workers in the state, mostly at Boeing. Boeing produces some of its largest planes only miles from where Trump spoke Tuesday night. As they are assembled, the painted tails of the planes show the airlines that ordered them, and many are Asian. Major components of each plane come from overseas: South Korea, China and Europe. Over the next 20 years, Boeing projects that Asian customers will account for 40 percent of the total global jetliner’s market, the company said in a recent report. “Trade is a huge part of the success of manufacturing in Washington,” said Linda Dempsey, vice president of international economic affairs for the National Association of Manufacturers, which Boeing belongs to. “They are exporting $73 billion in manufactured goods.” But Trump offers a more dire outlook, arguing that only he can keep Boeing from moving those high-paying manufacturing jobs from Washington to China. “They’ll start taking your business away, and you won’t have much of Boeing,” Trump told Seattle’s KIRO radio on Monday. Trump has broken with the Republican Party’s traditional embrace of free trade. He has vowed to rip up the TPP and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, an existing deal with Canada and Mexico which he blames for the loss of U.S. jobs. The Republican Party’s support for free trade has put it in sync with large business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. Tony Fratto, a former official in the administration of Republican George W. Bush, criticized Trump as out of step with the party. “Trump’s policies in this area are really dumb generally, but are particularly dumb for a major exporting company,” said Fratto, who worked on behalf of a coalition of large companies, including Boeing, that were pushing for renewal of the Export-Import Bank. Some voters in Washington state remain divided. Kirk Hoeppner, 53, a business analyst at Boeing who lives in Granite Falls, Washington, said he will vote for Trump and he agrees with his business views. But he was not sure closer ties to other countries would hurt jobs there. “Even if we ally with other countries, we’re still going to sell more airplanes,” Hoeppner said. Corey McNally, 40, of Whidbey Island, Washington, has not decided whom he will vote for. “The union members love Hillary just because they’re supposed to because she’s a liberal,” said McNally. And Trump, whom he called “just kind of a big show,” may be too late to change anything. “This company’s been outsourcing jobs for years,” he said of Boeing.",politicsNews,"August 30, 2016 ",1
12165,UK Diplomat Says He’s Met With DNC Leaker…They’re NOT Russian…They’re An Insider [VIDEO],"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has clearly stated his leaks did not come from Russia. Watch:Former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray, who is a close associate of Julian Assange, said he has met the DNC leaker and he s not Russian. h/t GPI have watched incredulous as the CIA s blatant lie has grown and grown as a media story   blatant because the CIA has made no attempt whatsoever to substantiate it. There is no Russian involvement in the leaks of emails showing Clinton s corruption. Yes this rubbish has been the lead today in the Washington Post in the US and the Guardian here, and was the lead item on the BBC main news. I suspect it is leading the American broadcasts also.A little simple logic demolishes the CIA s claims. The CIA claim they  know the individuals  involved. Yet under Obama the USA has been absolutely ruthless in its persecution of whistleblowers, and its pursuit of foreign hackers through extradition. We are supposed to believe that in the most vital instance imaginable, an attempt by a foreign power to destabilize a US election, even though the CIA knows who the individuals are, nobody is going to be arrested or extradited, or (if in Russia) made subject to yet more banking and other restrictions against Russian individuals? Plainly it stinks. The anonymous source claims of  We know who it was, it was the Russians  are beneath contempt.As Julian Assange has made crystal clear, the leaks did not come from the Russians. As I have explained countless times, they are not hacks, they are insider leaks   there is a major difference between the two. And it should be said again and again, that if Hillary Clinton had not connived with the DNC to fix the primary schedule to disadvantage Bernie, if she had not received advance notice of live debate questions to use against Bernie, if she had not accepted massive donations to the Clinton foundation and family members in return for foreign policy influence, if she had not failed to distance herself from some very weird and troubling people, then none of this would have happened.It is terrible that the prime conduit for this paranoid nonsense is a once great newspaper, the Washington Post, which far from investigating executive power, now is a sounding board for totally evidence free anonymous source briefing of utter bullshit from the executive.In the UK, one single article sums up the total abnegation of all journalistic standards. The truly execrable Jonathan Freedland of the Guardian writes  Few credible sources doubt that Russia was behind the hacking of internal Democratic party emails, whose release by Julian Assange was timed to cause maximum pain to Hillary Clinton and pleasure for Trump.  Does he produce any evidence at all for this assertion? No, none whatsoever. What does a journalist mean by a  credible source ? Well, any journalist worth their salt in considering the credibility of a source will first consider access. Do they credibly have access to the information they claim to have?Now both Julian Assange and I have stated definitively the leak does not come from Russia. Do we credibly have access? Yes, very obviously. Very, very few people can be said to definitely have access to the source of the leak. The people saying it is not Russia are those who do have access. After access, you consider truthfulness. Do Julian Assange and I have a reputation for truthfulness? Well in 10 years not one of the tens of thousands of documents WikiLeaks has released has had its authenticity successfully challenged. As for me, I have a reputation for inconvenient truth telling.Contrast this to the  credible sources  Freedland relies on. What access do they have to the whistleblower? Zero. They have not the faintest idea who the whistleblower is. Otherwise they would have arrested them. What reputation do they have for truthfulness? It s the Clinton gang and the US government, for goodness sake.The worst thing about all this is that it is aimed at promoting further conflict with Russia. This puts everyone in danger for the sake of more profits for the arms and security industries   including of course bigger budgets for the CIA.

4814,IRS Slams Trump Foundation For Breaking The Law,"The Donald J. Trump Foundation just quietly paid an IRS fine for breaking the law. Trump paid the IRS a $2,500 fine after the Washington Post exposed that his foundation had broken the law by giving a political foundation to a group connected to Florida attorney general Pam Bondi.The improper donation, a $25,000 gift from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, was made in 2013. At the time, Attorney General Pam Bondi was considering whether to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University. She decided not to pursue the case.Bondi s decision to let Trump University skate despite allegations of wrongdoing after the Trump donation has caused considerable controversy, with some demanding an investigation into possible corruption by the Republican attorney general.The Washington Post found that Trump didn t notify the IRS about his donation and it was recorded as a donation to a completely different organization.In that year s tax filings, The Post reported, The Trump Foundation did not notify the IRS of this political donation. Instead, Trump s foundation listed a donation   also for $25,000   to a Kansas charity with a name similar to that of Bondi s political group. In fact, Trump s foundation had not given the Kansas group any money at all.The prohibited gift was, in effect, replaced with an innocent-sounding but nonexistent donation.Trump claims that the misfiled donation was simply a mistake, but it fits into a pattern of Trump and his organization and so-called charities moving money around in a dubious fashion. An investigation by the same newspaper has tried to verify Trump s wild claims of charitable donations, but has so far been completely unable to do so.Earlier this year, Trump had failed to donate to veteran s charities, despite his promise to do so months ago. He only finally gave in and gave money to veterans after the news reports surfaced and politicians like Hillary Clinton attacked him for stiffing the organization.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 1, 2016",1

If they can only get FOX News to stop reporting about it, this whole nightmare for Obama s executive amnesty/votes for Democrats program will go away The parents of Kathryn Steinle said Monday in a cable television news interview that they support a proposal to give mandatory prison time to deported people who return to the U.S. illegally. Steinle, 32, was walking along a waterfront in San Francisco when she was shot by a gun allegedly fired by Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, a Mexican national who was in the country illegally. Steinle s brother also appeared on Fox and revealed to Megyn Kelly that the White House hasn t even bothered to reach out to the family. Not heard a word,  Brad Steinle said. Instead, he said,  we find solace in the fact that Kate was doing what she loved and she was with the man she loved the most, my dad. WATCH VIDEO INTERVIEW WITH BILL O REILLY HERE:Sanchez, 45, who has pleaded not guilty, had been released from jail months before the shooting, despite a federal immigration order asking local authorities to hold him.Jim Steinle and Liz Sullivan, of Pleasanton, California, were interviewed by Fox News talk-show host Bill O Reilly for a Monday segment on The O Reilly Factor.The death of their daughter has fueled a national debate on immigration, with advocates of stricter border control and even some Bay Area Democrats denouncing San Francisco as a city whose immigrant  sanctuary  protections harbor people who are in the country illegally.Supporters of sanctuary protections have jumped on O Reilly and others for politicizing the death. They say public safety is improved when immigrants can work with local police without fear of deportation.Steinle, who was at his daughter s side when she was shot, and his wife said the proposed  Kate s Law  would be a good way to keep her memory alive. O Reilly is collecting signatures for the petition, which would impose a mandatory five years in federal prison for people who are deported and return. We feel the federal, state and cities their laws are here to protect us,  Jim Steinle said.  But we feel that this particular set of circumstances and the people involved, the different agencies let us down. It ll be a legacy in her name and her death would not go unnoticed. The grieving parents said failings at multiple levels of government led to Sanchez being freed, but they re tired of finger-pointing.  Ff  Kate s Law  saves one person, then it s all for good,  said Steinle.Federal records show Sanchez had been deported three times before being sentenced to more than five years in federal prison. He had completed another four years in federal prison when he was shipped to San Francisco March 26 on an outstanding 1995 drug charge.The San Francisco District Attorney s office declined to prosecute, given the age of the case and the small amount of marijuana involved.Via: UK Daily Mail",Government News,"Jul 14, 2015",1
21087,Indonesian minister to meet Suu Kyi amid protests over Rohingya,"Indonesia s foreign minister is due to meet Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Monday to discuss delivering humanitarian aid to members of Myanmar s Rohingya minority, as Indonesian protesters urged their government to take a tougher line.  Dozens of Indonesians protested outside the Myanmar embassy in Jakarta on Monday, calling for a cut in diplomatic ties with Myanmar over violence against its Rohingya Muslim minority. Aid agencies estimate that about 90,000 Rohingya have fled from Myanmar into neighboring Bangladesh since violence erupted in the north of Rakhine state last week.    We will discuss in detail Indonesia s proposal on how Indonesia can give humanitarian aid to Rakhine state,  Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said in a video statement from the Myanmar city of Yangon. She is also scheduled to travel to Bangladesh to urge authorities there to protect fleeing Rohingya refugees. In a sign of mounting public anger in Jakarta, a petrol bomb was thrown at the Myanmar embassy on Sunday, causing a small fire. The protests follow demonstrations in Malaysia and condemnation from world leaders such as President Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who on Friday said the violence against Muslims amounted to genocide. The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar and regarded as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots that date back centuries. Bangladesh is also growing increasingly hostile to Rohingya, more than 400,000 of whom live in the poor South Asian country after fleeing Myanmar since the early 1990s. Indonesia is home to the world s largest population of Muslims. Its government has been actively involved in providing aid for Myanmar to develop Rakhine state and protect the rights of the Rohingya, alongside the majority Buddhist community.     Ifah Rohma, an activist from a Jakarta-based organization called Muslim Friends of Rohingya, said many Indonesians as fellow Muslims were concerned about the fate of Rohingya.  Indonesia should not be engaging in soft diplomacy,  Rohma said outside the Myanmar embassy, which was surrounded by heavy security and barbed wire.  Now is the time to cut ties, recall our ambassador and expel their ambassador,  she said. Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  responsible for a string of attacks on police posts and the army since last October.",worldnews,"September 4, 2017 ",1
9080,New York lawmakers vote to legalize fantasy sports games,"Fantasy sports moved a step closer to being legal in New York on Saturday when lawmakers approved the daily and season-long games, clearing a path for FanDuel, DraftKings and others to offer them to millions of players in the state. The multibillion-dollar industry, where players draft fantasy teams for sports including football, basketball and baseball, has drawn increased scrutiny since last year with the attorneys general of several U.S. states, including New York, Illinois and Nevada, questioning the legality of the games. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had held off on pursuing litigation against the fantasy companies for what he claimed were illegal gambling operations, and the companies have suspended their “games of skill” while the proposed legislation was in train. New York’s Senate passed the measure 45-17 early Saturday morning, sending the legislation that regulates and taxes the operators of fantasy sports games to Governor Andrew Cuomo. It is unclear whether Cuomo will sign the legislation, which the Assembly passed on Friday.  Daily fantasy sports, a turbocharged version of the season-long game where players draft teams in live games played in just one evening or over a weekend, has boomed over the past decade. State Assembly Gaming Committee Chairman J. Gary Pretlow predicted Cuomo would endorse the bill, partly because many young New York voters play the fantasy games and because it would generate tax revenues. “It’s a good thing for New Yorkers because there are more than three and half million participants, most of them millennials,” Pretlow said. DraftKings, which has dominated the industry along with FanDuel, praised the legislation as providing what it called a “sensible framework for regulating our games”.  In a statement on Saturday, the company said it would resume operations soon with new rules that provide “fairness and transparency at the core” of all its contests, assuming the governor signs the legislation. FanDuel pointed out that New York was the seventh state to pass a fantasy sports bill this year, following Colorado, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Virginia. “It speaks to the popularity of our game” said Nigel Eccles, the company’s CEO and co-founder. The New York legislation calls for a 15 percent annual state tax on gross revenues of all sports fantasy contests with an entry fee. Another 0.5 percent will be assessed each year on the companies with a maximum of $50,000. State Senator John Bonacic, who sponsored the bill, estimates annual state revenues will be about $5.5 million, adding that the measure is “going to make a lot of New Yorkers very happy”. The legislation survived heavy opposition from casino companies operating in New York. Opponents said it would weaken New York’s current gaming operations, including the horse racing industry which has been propped up by state government, by giving gamblers more options. After intense lobbying from the fantasy gaming industry, which retained former pro quarterbacks Jim Kelly and Vinny Testaverde to promote the games, lawmakers beat a June 30 deadline to set regulations. Schneiderman said in a statement on Saturday that he would enforce the law as amended, but his office would still pursue claims that DraftKings and FanDuel had engaged in false advertising and consumer fraud.

Human rights campaigners hailed the court s verdict as a landmark decision in a country where they say rape by armed groups is commonplace and often unpunished. The fighters from Djeshi ya Yesu - the Army of Jesus - militia were accused of raping at least 37 girls near the village of Kavumu in Democratic Republic of Congo s South Kivu province between 2013 and 2016, the rights groups said. According to the prosecution, the group s leader, provincial lawmaker Frederic Batumike, employed a spiritual adviser who told the fighters that raping very young children would give them mystical protection against their enemies. Militia members, including Batumike, were also convicted of murder, membership in a rebel movement and illegal weapons possession. The court ruled that the rapes and murders amounted to crimes against humanity, the rights groups said. The crimes triggered an international outcry. Rights groups accused the government of a slow response.  This was necessary. The victims have been waiting. It s a strong signal to anyone who would contemplate this kind of offense,  Charles Cubaka Cicura, a lawyer for the victims, told Reuters after the verdict was announced.  Millions died in eastern Congo in regional wars between 1996 and 2003, most from hunger and disease. Dozens of armed groups continue to prey on local population and fight for control of the area s rich natural resources. Experts say Congo has made some progress in combating sexual violence and several high-level militia and army commanders have been prosecuted in recent years, but the problem remains pervasive.  This trial demonstrated that justice can be served in the Congo ... even when the accused wield significant power and are highly organised,  said Karen Naimer of Physicians for Human Rights, one of the groups supporting the victims. The mobile court which set up in Kavumu village allocated $5,000 in compensation to each rape victim and $15,000 to the families of men murdered by the militia, the groups said.",worldnews,"December 13, 2017 ",0
2927,"Trump to Senate Republicans: kill Obamacare now, replace later","U.S. President Donald Trump urged Republican senators in a tweet on Friday to repeal Obamacare immediately if they cannot agree on a new plan to replace it, muddying the waters as congressional leaders struggle for consensus on healthcare legislation. Senate Republican leaders had set Friday as the target for rewriting legislation for a simultaneous repeal and replacement of extensive parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the law dubbed Obamacare that expanded health insurance coverage to 20 million people. The deadline seemed unlikely to be met given that most senators had left Washington ahead of next week’s recess, without agreement on a clear direction for the healthcare bill, and Trump’s tweet did not appear to gain political traction. Financial markets showed little reaction to Trump’s suggestion, with the benchmark S&P 500 index edging about 0.15 percent higher on the day. Shares of most health insurers gained fractionally while hospital stocks were little changed. Trump wrote on Twitter Friday morning, “If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!”  The White House said later that Trump was still “fully committed” to pushing the Republican draft healthcare bill through the Senate, although it was looking at every option for repealing and replacing Obamacare. “The president hasn’t changed his thinking at all,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. The current Senate legislation would repeal parts of Obamacare, roll back its expansion of the Medicaid government healthcare program for the poor, eliminate most of Obamacare’s taxes and replace Obamacare insurance subsidies with a system of tax credits to help individuals buy private health insurance. Conservative and moderate Republicans have spent recent days pushing and pulling the bill in opposite directions as Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell sought common ground. Moderates want more equity for low-income Americans, while conservatives are fighting to loosen insurance regulations. Shortly before his January inauguration, Trump urged lawmakers to repeal and replace Obamacare at the same time.  Congressional Republicans had considered earlier this year first repealing, then replacing Obamacare, but backed away after some lawmakers protested that that approach could create a gap in insurance coverage for millions. On Friday, Republican Senator Ben Sasse who had suggested that Congress first repeal Obamacare and then replace it, tweeted: “Glad you agree, Mr. Pres.” Conservative Senator Rand Paul also backed the idea. But others on Capitol Hill sounded annoyed. A senior Senate Republican aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that if lawmakers had been able to get the votes for repealing Obamacare first, then replacing it, “senators would have done that in January. It doesn’t have the votes, and it’s a waste of valuable time to discuss it.” Annie Clark, a spokeswoman for moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins, said the lawmaker would not support the strategy. McConnell’s spokesman declined to comment on Trump’s tweet.    A senior House of Representatives Republican, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, said in an interview for CSPAN’s “Newsmakers” program that lawmakers’ goal should continue to be “not simply repealing but to start to put into place the elements that can make healthcare affordable.”",politicsNews,"June 30, 2017 ",1

18388,"U.S. expels 15 Cuban diplomats, fuelling tensions with Havana","The Trump administration on Tuesday expelled 15 Cuban diplomats to protest Cuba s failure to protect staff at the U.S. embassy in Havana from a mysterious spate of health  attacks,  spurring new tensions between the former Cold War foes. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the expulsions from Cuba s embassy in Washington were also intended to ensure  equity  in staffing levels, after he recalled more than half the U.S. diplomatic personnel in Havana on Friday. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez denounced the decision as  unjustified,  accused the United States of insufficient cooperation with Cuba s investigation of the health incidents and urged Washington to stop politicizing the matter. The steps taken by Republican President Donald Trump s administration delivers another blow to his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama s policy of rapprochement, including actions likely to erode the normalization of a relationship dominated for decades by mutual hostility and suspicion. The latest U.S. move was communicated to Cuban Ambassador Jose Ramon Cabanas on Tuesday, and the diplomats were given seven days to leave, a State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Until the Government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba, our embassy will be reduced to emergency personnel to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,  Tillerson said in a statement.  We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks,  he added. The United States announced on Friday that it was sharply reducing its diplomatic presence in Cuba, as it warned U.S. citizens not to visit the Communist-ruled island because of the alleged attacks it says have caused hearing loss, dizziness and fatigue in 22 U.S. embassy personnel. The State Department had said the embassy was halting regular visa operations for Cubans seeking to visit the United States and would offer only emergency services to U.S. citizens. Cuba has denied involvement in any attacks and says it has reinforced security for U.S. diplomatic personnel. Rodriguez said lack of U.S. cooperation had stymied its own investigation into the matter. Authorities had not provided access to the injured people and the doctors who examined them, or to the homes where the attacks allegedly took place, he said, adding that evidence had been delivered late.  Rodriguez urged the United States to cooperate more and said Cuba was also working with Canada on the investigation as Canadian diplomats have reported similar symptoms. So far, none of the probes have yielded any answers about how the alleged attacks were carried out or who was responsible. Several Cuban-American Republican lawmakers, including U.S Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, had urged that Cuban diplomats be kicked out in retaliation for the Cuban government s failure to get to the bottom of the attacks.  I commend the U.S. State Department for expelling a number of Cuban operatives from the U.S.,  Rubio, an influential voice on Trump s Cuba policy, said in a statement. But James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a Washington-based pro-engagement lobbying group said:  This decision appears to be purely political, driven by the desire of a handful of individuals in Congress to halt progress between our two countries.   It looks like we are returning the threats and tensions of the 1960s,  said Maria Fernandez, a 45-year-old office worker in Havana.  This is madness by Trump. It s really sad, because we are so close, and yet so far away from a sincere rapprochement.  Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor Obama after five decades of hostility, called the Cuban government  corrupt and destabilizing  in his address to the United Nations last month. Cuba described his comments as  unacceptable and meddling.  Rodriguez urged the United States  not to continue politicizing this matter, which can provoke an undesirable escalation and could rarify and reverse even more bilateral relations.  In Havana, U.S. diplomats frantically selling off their belongings at garage sales and on social media, said they were disappointed to be ordered to leave. In a message on Facebook, the embassy s top official, career diplomat Scott Hamilton, said he would also be leaving.  I am an optimist and hope we will return one day, before too long,  he wrote.

6706,Woman Who Wants To Control Texas Education Thinks Preschool Makes Kids Gay (IMAGE),"There s currently a woman who wants to be selected to serve on the Texas State Board of Education (SBOE). Her name is Mary Lou Bruner, and she s about as far-right in ideology as one could ever seem to imagine. She s an ultra-right-wing  Christian  conservative who believes heavily in conspiracy theories, and her latest theory is just a bonkers as all her others.According to Evan Smith of the Texas Tribune, Bruner is now putting out the theory that preschool programs are a plot to make children gay. Not only that, but to also turn kids against their parents who  do not accept Islam and gay marriage. Smith, who seems to have access to the SBOE hopeful s private account, tweeted out a screen-capture of Bruner s Facebook post declaring this absurd theory. In the post, Bruner said: The GLBTQ agenda is one of the big reasons the liberals want 3-year-old and 4-year-old children to attend public school Pre-K programs. The federal government wants to indoctrinate the little children, teaching them a homosexual marriage is just as good as a marriage with a father and a mother. The federal government wants to push its socialistic and multicultural agenda onto these impressionable litter children who believe anything they are told.Children who get government indoctrination in Pre-K are going to become confused about their sexuality, and they are going to become rebellious because the government curriculum plans to tell the children not to listen to their parents if their parents tell them something different. The government curriculum plans to tell the little children their parents are ignorant, and they don t understand because of the way the parents were taught. Or the little children will be told their parents are bigoted because they do not accept Islam and gay marriage. Likely #SBOE member Mary Lou Bruner: pre-K is feds indoctrinating kids to make them sexually confused #txlege pic.twitter.com/ngMtsOq1S3  Evan Smith (@evanasmith) April 22, 2016The fact that this woman is running for the Texas State Board of Education and could very well have influence over what is taught is absolutely terrifying. Bruner is clearly a few sandwiches short of a picnic.Newsflash to Bruner: you re not taught to be gay, and teaching acceptance and love of others is actually the Christian thing to do. As a person who was raised in a very evangelical Christian home and is also a lesbian, let me tell you, if you re taught to be gay, where the hell did I learn it? The only learned behavior Bruner is promoting is wanting to teach kids to be discriminatory, vindictive, and hateful of anyone who doesn t fit her definition of how to live one s life.Bruner needs to stay as far away from educational decisions as possible. She needs to keep her crazy conspiracy theories within the confines of her own home. She s truly what is actually dangerous, not kids getting early childhood education.

16671,U.S. coalition denies deadly strike in Syria's Deir al-Zor city,"The U.S.-led coalition on Tuesday denied striking Deir al-Zor city in eastern Syria after Damascus accused its jets of killing more than a dozen people.  Syrian state television had said the U.S.-led coalition hit the government-held Qusur district, killing 14 civilians and wounding 32, on Monday.  The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was unclear which aircraft carried out the raid, but that it killed at least 22 people. Colonel Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, said on Tuesday that its jets had not conducted air strikes on any part of the eastern city. The coalition says it investigates any such allegations and is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and neighboring Iraq.  The Syrian army controls much of Deir al-Zor city, after pushing into it last month with the help of Russian air strikes and Iran-backed militias. That advance broke an Islamic State siege of an enclave there which had lasted nearly three years. Syrian troops and allied forces are now fighting Islamic State militants in a few remaining districts of the city, and in nearby parts of Deir al-Zor province. The U.S.-led coalition has been striking Islamic State targets to back an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias in other parts of the province across the Euphrates river. The United States and Russia have said they communicate with each other to prevent possible points of conflict between the two separate offensives.",worldnews,"October 24, 2017 ",0
6017,Trump says he will order 'safe zones' for Syria,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he “will absolutely do safe zones in Syria” for refugees fleeing violence in the war-torn country. Saying Europe had made a tremendous mistake by admitting millions of refugees from Syria and other Middle Eastern trouble spots, Trump told ABC News in an interview: “I don’t want that to happen here.” “I’ll absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people,” he added, without giving details. According to a document seen by Reuters on Wednesday, Trump is expected to order the Pentagon and the State Department in coming days to craft a plan for setting up the “safe zones,” a move that could risk escalation of U.S. military involvement in Syria’s civil war. The draft executive order awaiting Trump’s signature signaled the new administration was preparing a step that Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, long resisted, fearing the potential for being pulled deeper into the bloody conflict and the threat of clashes between U.S. and Russian warplanes over Syria. “The Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense, is directed within 90 days of the date of this order to produce a plan to provide safe areas in Syria and in the surrounding region in which Syrian nationals displaced from their homeland can await firm settlement, such as repatriation or potential third-country resettlement,” the draft order said. Creation of safe zones could ratchet up U.S. military involvement in Syria and mark a major departure from Obama’s more cautious approach. Increased U.S. or allied air power would be required if Trump chooses to enforce “no fly” restrictions, and ground forces might also be needed to protect civilians in those areas.  Still, the document gave no details on what would constitute a safe zone, exactly where they might be set up and who would defend them. Jordan, Turkey and other neighboring countries already host millions of Syrian refugees. The Turkish government had long pressed Obama, without success, for creation of a no-fly zone in Syria on its border with Turkey. The draft raised the possibility of establishing those safe havens in neighboring countries but did not elaborate. Trump’s call for a plan for safe zones is part of a larger directive expected to be signed in coming days that includes a temporary ban on most refugees to the United States and a suspension of visas for citizens of Syria and six other Middle Eastern and African countries deemed to pose a terrorism threat. It represents a modified version of the blanket ban on Muslims entering the United States that Trump initially advocated on the campaign trail last year, sparking criticism from human rights groups and across the U.S. political spectrum. U.S. military officials had long warned that the creation of no-fly zones inside Syria would require a large number of additional resources beyond the fight against Islamic State and it would be difficult to ensure that jihadist insurgents did not infiltrate those areas amid the chaos of Syria’s civil war. Some Republican lawmakers have advocated the creation of such zones, especially to protect civilians fleeing the conflict against attacks by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. During and after the presidential campaign, Trump called for no-fly zones to harbor Syrian refugees as an alternative to allowing them into the United States. Trump accused the Obama administration of failing to properly screen Syrian immigrants  entering the United States to ensure they had no militant ties. Obama’s aides have insisted the vetting was meticulous and none of the Syrian refugees allowed in have been implicated in any attacks.  On the campaign trail, Trump gave no details as to how he might go about creating such havens, except to say that he would ask Gulf states to help pay. “All the questions of setting up a safe zone are still there,” a U.S. official said. “If you’re going to declare a safe zone, there’s a lot of other things” that would have to be analyzed and put in place before it becomes feasible. Among the biggest questions would be how to avoid confrontations with Russian forces in Syria helping keep Assad in power.   Under the broader executive order, which the draft document says is intended to “protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals,” Trump would impose a 30-day suspension of the entry of immigrants from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The temporary halt is aimed at giving the homeland security secretary, the secretary of state and the director of national intelligence enough time to determine what information is needed from each country to ensure visas are not issued to individuals that pose a national security threat, according to the draft. Countries that do not provide adequate information about their nationals will be required to do so within 60 days or risk being blocked from entering the United States. That would exclude diplomatic visas, NATO visas and visas for travel to the United Nations. It would also suspend the overall U.S. refugee program for 120 days so the government can study the process and determine if additional checks are necessary, but that could be waived on a case-by-case basis. It would completely stop refugee processing of Syrians until “I have determined that sufficient changes have been made” to the refugee program to ensure “its alignment with national interest,” the draft said.",politicsNews,"January 25, 2017 ",0
12377,Meet The LEFTIST Assistant Professor Who Made Up Bogus List Of “Fake” Conservative Websites That Went Viral,"Approximately one year ago, my business partner sent me a screen shot of a list of  phony  or  not to be trusted  websites  that was going around Facebook. Our website (100percentfedup.com), along with several other conservative websites like Breitbart, IJ Review, Infowars, Biz Pac Review and The Blaze were included on this list. Most of the websites listed had a considerable amount of traffic and cumulatively reach hundreds of millions of readers. I told her to ignore it, that it was clearly created by some leftist organization who was trying to discredit conservative websites. One year later, a list that has striking similarities has been revived. This time however, the list has been amended to include ONE liberal website,  Occupy Democrats  and has a new author, Melissa Zimdars. After all, a list of 90  phony  or  misleading  websites wouldn t be legitimate if at least one of them wasn t a liberal site right?While some of the websites on the list are fake and should be called out as such, there are WAY more legitimate conservative sites on this list who work very hard to vet their sources and to bring their readers truthful news they won t find in the mainstream media. After the election results came in, many on the Left were inconsolable and were lashing out at conservative news sites as the reason Hillary lost. It didn t take long for the Left to realize they had finally met their match with driven conservatives who were not going to roll over and let the Left drive the narrative this time around. Thus the list by Leftist activist Melissa Zimdars, that is being used to discredit many of us who take our jobs very seriously, and are doing all that we can to fight back against a biased media complex.We were curious about Melissa and her political leanings. Could this list have anything to do with wanting to  pay back  the sites who helped to topple Hillary? We did a little research on Melissa and found that her Twitter account is on lock-down. We found this to be slightly ironic considering she appears to be all about transparency. Thanks to Way Back Time Machine, we were able to find out a little bit about Melissa:Melissa is a follower of The Radical  Chicago Rising  and  The End Of Protest  who describes their group as  A new playbook for revolution by Micah White, co-creator of Occupy Wall Street: Melissa is big fan of Black Lives Matter, and was helping to promote the BLM march that threatened the safety and security of many innocent people in Chicago:Here s the real reason why Zimdar likely has her Twitter account on lockdown. She wouldn t want to let everyone know she just published a list of conservative sites that she suggests,  should never be trusted  and allow her hatred for Donald Trump to be exposed at the same time. Besides her hatred for Trump and Karl Rove (see below), she apparently gets  goosebumps  when she hears Bernie Sanders  name. I know what you re thinking She s sounding more  objective  all the time right?Melissa retweeted Hillary s angry tweet about Trump:She s no fan of Dr. Ben Carson and his belief that the government shouldn t be able to force employers to pay an arbitrary minimum wage:Melissa s story became popular after she posted it to her Facebook page, which should come as no surprise given the  friends  who are actively suggesting names of other conservative sites they detest that  Melissa needs to add to the her list. Even though Breitbart is on her  list , Zimdar s friend asks her,  Where s Brietbart? Other friends want to know how they can submit conservative sites that can be added to her list:And of course, what kind of conservative media  hit list  would be complete without Fox News? This friend suggests she needs to put FOX News at the  top  of the list:This Hillary supporter tells Zimdar she d like to use this list as a teaching tool in her class:Just another liberal agitator who plans to use this list to teach her students about honest journalism.Here is Zimdar admitting that not every site is always unreliable, that some,  waffle back and forth . But what the heck she ll leave them there anyhow:",politics,"Nov 16, 2016",0

928,New Poll: WAY More Americans Want Trump Impeached Than Approve Of The Job He Is Doing,"Donald Trump has been notorious for touting poll numbers that look good for him. During the campaign, whenever he d careen into one of his many controversies and the numbers dipped, he and his mouthpieces would reference junk polls to show that people still loved The Donald. Of course, any poll that can be voted in a million times online is bogus. However, factual data isn t bogus, and that data does not look good for Trump right now. In fact, a new poll shows that way more Americans want Trump removed from office than the number of people who think he s doing a good job.According to new data from Public Policy Polling, 47 percent of Americans see Donald Trump as the incompetent, dangerously unstable buffoon he is, and want him impeached posthaste. On the other hand, just 37 percent believe he is actually a good president. That isn t surprising; after all, the slavish, blind devotion of his mouthbreathing base has not been a secret for nigh on two years now.On the other side of said insane base, there were marches around the nation for the holiday weekend demanding Trump s removal and protesting his administration and their policies. Further, more Democrats are becoming emboldened by these numbers and are actually drafting articles of impeachment. One such Democrat is Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA). Speaking in his home district in Los Angeles, Rep. Sherman egged the anti-Trump crowd on, saying: We have to act now to protect our country from abuse of power and impulsive, ignorant incompetence. At this declaration, the crowd borrowed from Trump s own base, and shouted back:  LOCK HIM UP! Of course, there s one little difference between Trump s base and the Democrats   there s PLENTY of evidence to suggest that Trump is a criminal, while there is absolutely none to suggest the same about Hillary Clinton.Of course, there will be no impeachment until the Democrats take back the House of Representatives, and there will be no invocation of the 25th Amendment to remove and unfit  president  from office for the sake of the nation. Therefore, we MUST turn out in 2018, and make sure we control both chambers of Congress. That s the only way we get real, credible Congressional investigations into the Russia ordeal, and it s the only way we get rid of Trump and his criminal administration.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"July 5, 2017",1
9633,Exclusive: Top reason Americans will vote for Trump: 'To stop Clinton' - poll,"The U.S. presidential election may turn out to be one of the world’s biggest un-popularity contests.  Nearly half of American voters who support either Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump for the White House said they will mainly be trying to block the other side from winning, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday.  The results reflect a deepening ideological divide in the United States, where people are becoming increasingly fearful of the opposing party, a feeling worsened by the likely matchup between the New York real estate tycoon and the former first lady, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.  “This phenomenon is called negative partisanship,” Sabato said. ”If we were trying to maximize the effect, we couldn’t have found better nominees than Trump and Clinton.”  Trump has won passionate supporters and vitriolic detractors for his blunt talk and hardline proposals, including his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, his vow to force Mexico to pay for a border wall, and his promise to renegotiate international trade deals.  Former Secretary of State Clinton’s appeal to voters seeking continuity with President Barack Obama’s policies, has won her a decisive lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, but finds strong opponents among those disillusioned by what they see as lack of progress during Obama’s tenure.  The poll asked likely voters about the primary motivation driving their support of either Trump or Clinton heading into the general election on Nov. 8.  About 47 percent of Trump supporters said they backed him primarily because they don’t want Clinton to win. Another 43 percent said their primary motivation was a liking for Trump’s political positions, while 6 percent said they liked him personally.  Similar responses prevailed among Clinton supporters.  About 46 percent said they would vote for her mostly because they don’t want to see a Trump presidency, while 40 percent said they agreed with her political positions, and 11 percent said they liked her personally.  The April 29-May 5 poll included 469 likely Trump voters and 599 likely Clinton voters. It has a credibility interval of 5 percentage points. (For results, click tmsnrt.rs/1TLCbqX)  To be sure, voters’ opinions could change over the next several months. Candidates will be feted at party conventions, will square off in a series of national debates, and will be targeted by millions of dollars worth of advertisements.  But the negative atmosphere is likely to reign, says Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University professor who has studied the rise of negative partisanship in America.  Both campaigns probably will decide their best strategy is to work even harder to vilify each other, he said.  “It’s going to get very, very negative,” he added.  That would play into a longer-term trend.  A 2014 study by Pew Research Center found that Democrats and Republicans have shown increasingly negative views toward each other over the past few decades. In 2014 more than a quarter of Democrats, and more than a third of Republicans, viewed the opposition as “a threat to the nation’s well-being.”  Barbara Monson, 59, a Republican from Murray, Utah, is among them. “No matter who the Republican (nominee) is, I would have voted for him,” poll respondent Monson said of her support for Trump. “It’s never going to be Clinton. Never.”  Jo-Anne Michaud, 69, an independent voter from Abingdon, Maryland, told Reuters she would try to keep an open mind. Although she has voted for both Republicans and Democrats in the past, she feels repelled by Trump.  “I used to like the guy when I watched his show,” Michaud said. “But I just hate the way he talks now. I don’t think he’s a nice person deep down inside.”",politicsNews,"May 6, 2016 ",1
3036,Top Democrat slams Obama administration's response to Russian hacks,"The top Democrat on the U.S. House Intelligence Committee on Sunday criticized the administration of former President Barack Obama for not taking earlier and tougher action against Russia for its alleged hacks aimed at swaying the Nov. 8 election for Donald Trump. “The Obama administration should have done a lot more when it became clear that not only was Russia intervening, but it was being directed at the highest levels of the Kremlin,” said Representative Adam Schiff on CNN’s “State of the Union” program. The Obama administration imposed sanctions in December on two Russian intelligence agencies over their alleged involvement in hacking political groups during the election, but those sanctions were too little, too late, Schiff said. Schiff and his Senate counterpart, Dianne Feinstein, issued an unusual public statement in September condemning Russia for the alleged hacks. “We had to vet that with the intelligence community, but we took that step because we weren’t succeeding in getting the administration to do it itself,” Schiff said.",politicsNews,"June 25, 2017 ",0
18642,China says U.S. should respect concerns on Taiwan,"The United States must respect China s concerns on Taiwan to avoid causing disturbances in Sino-U.S. ties, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told visiting U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Saturday. China considers democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is the island s main source of arms. China regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States, and has been upset by U.S. moves to expand military exchanges with Taiwan and continued U.S. arms sales to the island. Wang explained China s position on the Taiwan issue and  demanded the U.S. side earnestly respect China s concerns, appropriately handle the relevant issue and avoid bringing disturbances to China-U.S. relations , China s Foreign Ministry said. It did not elaborate. Beijing s relationship with Taiwan has been frosty since President Tsai Ing-wen won election on the island by a landslide last year. China suspects that Tsai, who leads the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China. In recent months the Chinese air force has conducted a series of drills around Taiwan, which have included bombers and advanced fighter jets, alarming Taipei. China has called the exercises routine and pledged to continue with them.",worldnews,"September 30, 2017 ",1
10067,House ethics committee continues probe of Florida's Grayson,"The ethics committee of the U.S. House of Representatives said on Tuesday it would continue to investigate possible conflicts of interest by Representative Alan Grayson, a Florida Democrat and liberal firebrand running for the Senate seat soon to be vacated by Marco Rubio.      The possible conflicts of interest relate to Grayson’s roles as both a hedge fund manager and a member of Congress. The committee in a statement said the matter needed further review; it gave no time frame for completion. Grayson has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement Tuesday, his campaign called the ethics probe a “political witch hunt.” The extension means the issue will still hover over a race that is seen as key to Democrats’ bid to wrest control of the Senate from Republicans in November’s elections. The primary is in August. The New York Times reported in February that emails and the fund’s marketing documents showed Grayson had promoted his international travels, some with congressional delegations, to solicit business for the fund, in possible violation of House ethics rules.  “The larger picture here is that the Washington political establishment has decided who their favored candidate is, and it’s not Rep. Grayson,” the statement from Grayson’s campaign said. Top Democrats have tried to get Grayson to drop out of the Florida Senate race because of the questions about the hedge fund, throwing their support to Democratic opponent Representative Patrick Murphy. President Barack Obama has endorsed Murphy, and Vice President Joe Biden has campaigned with Murphy. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said earlier this year that Grayson’s actions had disgraced Congress and that he should leave the Senate race immediately.  But Grayson has been endorsed by some grassroots liberal groups who appreciate his outspokenness. One of his more famous lines, delivered during the Obamacare debate in 2009, was that the Republican health-care plan for America amounted to “don’t get sick,” and if you do, “die quickly.” The New York Times reported that Grayson had created the hedge fund in 2011 after losing a race for re-election to Congress, and kept it open after he was re-elected in 2012. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange, the fund had been called the Grayson Fund, but Grayson changed the name to Sibylline Fund LP. The Times reported the fund had closed branches previously located in the Cayman Islands. Rubio, who recently ended a campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, leaves the Senate after this year after just one term. Republicans seeking the seat include Representatives Ron DeSantis and David Jolly.",politicsNews,"April 5, 2016 ",1

3926,U.S. needs to balance foreign alliances: Tillerson,"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday outlined for his staff how an “America First” agenda translates into foreign policy, but did not address the Trump administration’s proposed budget cuts, which worry many diplomats. It was the first time Tillerson had addressed all employees since his first day on the job on Feb. 2, when he spoke to hundreds of State Department officials in the building’s lobby, and the most thorough explanation yet of the Trump administration’s approach to foreign policy. Some allies and even some U.S. officials have interpreted Republican President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda, which puts Americans’ interests at home ahead of those of its partners overseas, as a threat to retreat from the world. Tillerson said U.S. foreign policy priorities had gotten “a little bit out of balance” in the previous decades, with the United States too focused on promoting economic activity and trade with emerging economies. “These are really important relationships to us, and they’re really important alliances, but we’ve got to bring them back into balance,” he said, speaking without notes and walking around the stage in a packed State Department auditorium. He also signaled that the United States would de-emphasize human rights concerns in some of its interactions with other countries, saying that while U.S. values remain constant, its policies can adapt. “If we condition too heavily that others must adopt this value that we’ve come to over a long history of our own, it really creates obstacles to our ability to advance our national security interests, our economic interests,” Tillerson said. Tillerson gave a tour of U.S. priorities around the world, including in East Asia, Russia, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere, omitting Europe. With regard to North Korea’s nuclear program, Tillerson said the administration is willing to use so-called secondary sanctions to target foreign companies that continue to do business with Pyongyang in contravention of United Nations sanctions. The pressure campaign on North Korea is “at about dial setting 5 or 6 right now,” Tillerson said. On China, Tillerson said the United States has a “tremendous opportunity” to define its relationship with the superpower for the next several decades, and that he sensed great interest by the Chinese leadership to do that as well. He and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will chair a dialogue with their Chinese counterparts in June, in addition to a dialogue focused on economics and trade and led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Tillerson said he had told Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit to Moscow last month that U.S.-Russia relations were at their lowest point since the Cold War.  “He did not disagree,” Tillerson said. “He shrugged his shoulders and nodded in agreement.” But in remarks lasting nearly 40 minutes, Tillerson did not address the administration’s proposed 28 percent budget cut for U.S. diplomacy and foreign aid, which would reduce funding for the United Nations, climate change and cultural exchange programs. That proposal has made many American diplomats and aid workers anxious.  The Trump administration also has not named candidates for the vast majority of State Department positions requiring Senate confirmation, and many are being filled by career diplomats in “acting” positions. Tillerson began his remarks by thanking those officials, to applause from the crowd. One veteran official who watched the speech criticized Tillerson’s use of the “America First” slogan. The phrase was used in the 1930s by isolationists who sought to keep the United States out of World War Two. “The fact that they still use ‘America First’ shows they know nothing about history, and what’s worse is they don’t care. “It’s offensive,” said the official, who requested anonymity. Tillerson’s remarks followed an invitation to State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development employees this week to participate in an online survey to help identify “efficiency improvements,” in line with a March directive from Trump to “reorganize governmental functions and eliminate unnecessary agencies.” In his speech, the secretary urged employees to fill out the survey and give input on how to reform the agency. Tillerson said the State Department, like many institutions, was built for the Cold War era. He said he recognized that deep change to the State Department “is really stressful for a lot of people” and said the administration has “no preconceived notions on the outcome” of a review. One State Department official faulted Tillerson for not talking in detail about the budget cuts, as well as for not taking questions from employees. Previous secretaries of state, including Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton, held question-and-answer sessions with State Department employees within weeks of taking office. “They wanted to make this look like he was talking to us, but it was more about the appearance than any substance,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Two other State Department officials, however, spoke highly of Tillerson’s remarks, saying it was early to expect him to take questions from the rank and file and saying he provided guidance both on foreign policy and on the challenge of reorganizing the department. “I can understand folks wanting more details. I just don’t think we are in a place where he can provide more details,” said one of these officials about the expected State Department budget cuts. “My big takeaway was put on your big-girl britches, and when you look back you will feel like you were part of making this reform happen.”",politicsNews,"May 3, 2017 ",0
16320,Rights groups urge UK to request Bahrain free activist's relatives,"A group of 13 human rights organizations urged the British government to call for the release of three Bahrainis detained in the Gulf State, saying they were being punished because they were relatives of a London-based activist and his wife. In a letter sent to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, the group that includes Amnesty International and UK legal charity Reprieve called for the release of Sayed Nazar Alwadaei, Hajar Mansoor Hasan and Mahmood Marzooq Mansoor. The three are relatives of Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei and his wife Duaa Alwadaei. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei is the director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, a Britain-based group campaigning for political change in Bahrain. The three were arrested in March in Bahrain while Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei was attending the 34th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.  We therefore urge your government to request Bahrain to immediately release Mr and Mrs Alwadaei s relatives ahead of their October 30 trial and drop all charges against them,  said the letter sent on Thursday. It called the case  part of a pattern of abuse and harassment against human rights defenders and their families in Bahrain . The letter said the three detainees are facing up to three years in jail.  Bahrain is punishing his innocent family as retribution for his peaceful activism,  said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve. Bahrain s government officials could not be immediately reached for a comment. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei s family members have been under the spotlight of Bahrain s authorities since he took part in protest against the attendance of the Gulf state s king at a royal horse show in Britain. King Hamad attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show last year, and the state-run Bahrain News Agency BNA published his photographs with Britain s Queen Elizabeth II. Bahrain, which has a Shi ite Muslim majority population and is ruled by a Sunni royal family, has seen unrest since the  Arab Spring  protests across the region in 2011.

8505,Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm,"scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots. A vaccine is not expected to be ready for widespread use for at least two or three years. U.S. government researchers said they started their first clinical trial of a Zika vaccine. How dangerous is it? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said now that the causal relationship has been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years. According to the World Health Organization, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. In addition, the agency said it could cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. Conclusive proof of the damage caused by Zika may take months or years. Brazil reports the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly at more than 1,700 as doctors and Brazilian health officials find that some suspected cases of microcephaly are not the disorder. Suspected ones under investigation had declined to 3,257. Brazil registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus from February until April 2. Current research in Brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue. What are the symptoms of Zika infection?     People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. The symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito. How can Zika be contained? Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries where they may be exposed to Zika. How widespread is the outbreak? Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 54 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected. (1.usa.gov/1ovAJyh) Africa (1): Cape Verde  Americas (45): Anguilla, Antigua, Argentina, Aruba, Barbados, Barbuda, Belize, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaçao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saba, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelmy, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Eustatius, St. Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Cacos, U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela. Oceania/Pacific Islands (8): American Samoa, Fiji, Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga.  What is the history of the Zika virus? The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO.  Can Zika be transmitted through sexual contact? The World Health Organization (WHO) said sexual transmission is “relatively common” and has advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus. It also  advised women living in areas where the virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant. The U.S. CDC is investigating about a dozen cases of possible sexual transmission. Those cases involved possible transmission of the virus from men to their sex partners. But the CDC issued updated recommendations for preventing and testing for Zika infection on July 25, warning that the virus can be transmitted through unprotected sex with an infected female partner. A reported case of female-to-male sexual transmission in New York City, and limited human and non-human primate data indicating that Zika virus RNA can be detected in vaginal secretions, led to the new warning, the agency said. CDC’s expanded warnings on sexual exposure to Zika now  caution against sex without a condom or other barrier method of protection with any person, male or female, who has traveled to or lives in an area with Zika, including female to female transmission with a pregnant partner. British health officials reported Zika was found in a man’s semen two months after he was infected, suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade. The PAHO said Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism. There is no evidence Zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk. The WHO has identified Zika cases in Argentina, Chile, France, Italy and New Zealand as likely caused by sexual transmission.  What other complications are associated with Zika? Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue.",politicsNews,"August 4, 2016 ",0
19767,Army commander dismisses general's hint at army intervention in Brazil: reports,"Brazil s Army commander dismissed a general s suggestion that members of the Army s High Command endorse some sort of  military intervention  if high courts fail to stem political corruption, the online services of Brazil s two biggest newspapers said. At a gathering of freemasons in Bras lia last Friday, General Antonio Hamilton Mour o had suggested his fellows at the High Command think the current timing is not favorable for military intervention but that it could eventually take place through  successive steps,  Folha de S. Paulo said.  Either institutions sort out the political problem, through the judiciary branch of power and withdrawing from public life all those elements involved in illicit acts, or then we will have to impose that,  Mour o was quoted as saying by O Estado de S.

B as told Estado that since 1985, when a 21-year military dictatorship came to an end, the military was  not responsible for any source of turmoil in the nation s life, and it will continue to be like that.  While Mour o, currently the army s head of finance, hinted that there could come a time when the army would have to impose military action, he said it would not be to take power from civilians, Folha said. An action would aim at  telling people,  Beware, let s fix this now so the country can move forward and not continue the way it is,  the newspaper quoted him as saying. The army command did not immediately respond to request for comment. Mour o could not be found by Reuters to comment on his remarks. Mour o, in the army since 1972, was discharged from Brazil s South Military Command and transferred to the federal capital of Bras lia in 2015 for administrative work after publicly criticizing former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff.

23296,‘STRANGER THINGS’ – Hollywood MK Ultra Goes Full Occult,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireThe popular 80s pastiche series Stranger Things begins with a familiar scene of E.T. nostalgia, centering around Dungeons & Dragons. The scene is particularly familiar to me, since I played D&D back in the day, but learned very quickly this nefarious practice was like kryptonite to all things female.  Oddly enough, the series appears to reflect a new trend amongst Hollywood A-listers, where nerd culture has revived the ancient 80s practice of playing D&D.  The Hollywood Reporter explains the trend and its connection to acting and role-playing: Vin Diesel plays it. So do Dwayne Johnson, Drew Barrymore, Stephen Colbert, Mike Myers and Jon Favreau, among other bold-face names. Some even built their careers by playing it The decades-old role-playing game   in which participants roll multisided dice while pretending to be mystical creatures such as elves and dwarves   finally is coming out of the closet (or, in this case, Mom s basement).  There s a huge resurgence of nerd culture, especially with the tech boom,  says Silicon Valley s Martin Starr, a longtime D&D enthusiast.  If nerds were still poor and living at their mothers , nobody would be paying any attention to Dungeons & Dragons. But nerds rule the world, and D&D is making a big comeback   and I m excited about it. While this certainly relates to a furtherance of one s improv skills, it also relates to the occult side of Hollywood, though I don t take the ridiculous evangelical view that D&D is inherently evil.  Rather, the notion of role-playing is synonymous with the ancient view of acting as dramaturgy, or ritual invocation of the gods.  Comparative religion scholar Dudley Young writes: The earliest gods were invoked by ritual act (dromenon = the thing done) such as a sacrificial dance, commemorating the fact that our life begins and ends when they call upon us.  Subsequently the thing was said (legomenon) as well as done, and the dromenon was on its way to becoming the drama.  Once speech within the temple precincts has been endowed with the power of word-magic, we have  the invocation  properly so called.  (Dudley Young, Origins of the Sacred: The Ecstasies of Love and War, pg. 413)Set in the fictional small town of Hawkins, Indiana in 1983, we will see the accidental dramaturgical invocation where the D&D simulacrum appears to actually be related on a deeper level to the occult phenomena that begin to occur.  The disappearance of young Will Byers sparks a series of events that take Hawkins down a black rabbit hole of every conspiracy theory ever, melded with the opening of the inter-dimensional gates from every John Carpenter film. Originally slated to be titled  Montauk,  the series echoes the dubious accounts of Project Montauk, where purportedly time and space were altered in government-sponsored PsyOps and time travel  experiments with famed UFO researcher Jacques Vallee commenting the experiments were related to the Philadelphia Experiment.  For more information and speculation on this topic, I interviewed Dr. Farrell on his views here.D & D invokes the entities in E.T.. The stories of Montauk appear to originate in a book series by Preston Nichols, who claims to have discovered  repressed memories  of the event.  This laughable scenario immediately smacks of PsyOps, making the original connection to large-scale deception all the more appropriate.  Even Vallee alleges the  experiment is a hoax, suggesting an experiment in seeing what you can get people to believe, as opposed to some real space-time warping experiment. Vallee writes: I hypothesized that the experiments had to do with a radar countermeasures test. Indeed a Raytheon advertisement published thirteen years ago suggested that the corresponding technology was now out in the open (Raytheon, 1980). This hypothesis, however, failed to explain a few of the facts that highlighted the story. In particular it did not account for the observed disappearance of the destroyer from the harbor, for the mysterious devices brought on board under extreme security precautions, or for the alleged disappearance of two sailors from a nearby tavern. While it may be the case that the Navy altered space-time, does Vallee not consider the possibility this is all bullshit, as so many  military whistleblowers  and  generals  so often  leak ?  Rather, as is so often the case, all the  evidence  for these events relies on some retired Navy man with all the credentials of the Navy man from the Village People. This is also why the Montauk tale mixes aliens and other nonsense in with the notion of the Apollo Mission being staged   disinformation.  Vallee himself was a high up government operator with an interest in occultism and Rosicrucianism, and is represented in Spielberg s Close Encounters by the character of Claude Lacombe (played by Francois Truffaut).Through the dimensional gate: the Demogorgon saps energy and hatches incubus style demon-babies in Ridley Scott form. .Thus, all of this functions as the spirit behind Stranger Things, as well as myriad other influences, such as Star Wars, Alien, Goonies, H.P. Lovecraft, Evil Dead, X-Men, Stephen King, and John Carpenter.  That said, I consider the series as accurately showing some aspects of the spiritual realm, couched in scientistic mysticism, where our initial suspicion of extra-terrestrial alien manipulation is revealed to be both terrestrial and demonic.  The Demogorgon inhabits a realm that is the  upside down,  the negative or demonic dark side of our world, which matches up to the Kabbalistic notion of the Qilphoth or the Abyss of Da at at times, as Crowley claims: This doctrine is extremely difficult to explain; but it corresponds more or less to the gap in thought between the Real, which is ideal, and the Unreal, which is actual. In the Abyss all things exist, indeed, at least in posse, but are without any possible meaning; for they lack the substratum of spiritual Reality. They are appearances without Law. They are thus Insane Delusions  Now the Abyss being thus the great storehouse of Phenomena, it is the source of all impressions. Spoiler alert, but the missing children are not only part of MK Ultra, but are being used in top-secret testing that includes LSD, sensory deprivation and the development of Men Who Stare at Goats (or Kids Who Stare at Kittens)-type mental powers.  Interestingly, the abducted super-soldier kid named  11  and  El  is specifically told to kill a kitten which is rumored to be an aspect of trauma-based mind control.  Basically, all the rumors of hardcore child abuse and mind control are rolled into the series with the character  El,  who is able to remote view the spiritual realm and spy on Soviets (as well as Demogorgons).Like the simulacrum in Spielberg films, the spirits communicate across the void through the Kabbalistic principle of esoteric symbology and linguistics, as I showed in my Close Encounters analysis.. Oblivious to the dangers of such programs, Mr. Man in Black Shadow Government from the Dept. of Energy persists in hunting down his escaped  daughter  El (hinting at sexual abuse), who finds her way into the Goonies gang of Mike, Will and Lucas (I m assuming you ve seen it).  Most interesting is the biblical and occult notion of the opening of  gates  through such  scientific  experiments, which are in fact occult rituals involving child adduction and sacrifice under the guise of  cancer  research (MK Ultra).  Could this be a hint at what the cancer complex is really involved in?  Genetic and psychological experimentation with children for the  greater good ?  Certainly there have been numerous cases of missing children in the US, as well as small towns experimented on by the shadow government.  It would seem that Stanger Things is obliquely referencing these themes, as well as the possibility of actual murders and abductions, as author William Ramsey argues here.Given blood and sacrifice bring the demon and open the gate, we can assume the references are to the goetia, where demons are invoked through sigils. . Two notions that occurred to me I have not seen tacked yet in the series is the strange reference to the loss of  father  and  God,  as we see no strong male figures.  Hop the cop, like a horny rabbit, hops from girl to girl having lost his daughter, while Will s father is a deadbeat.  In Mike and Nancy s household, the ineffectual, sterile father character of Mr. Wheeler remains ever clueless while arguing to Mrs. Wheeler the  government is on our side,  and would never lie.Set in the Cold War, the fear and panic of the ridiculous  Russian Threat  in the background of the series allows the shadow state to develop the explicitly-named Star Wars Defense Program, where  lasers and space weapons  are being made to destroy the  Russkies.  Amazingly accurate in this insight, this is a point JaysAnalysis has been highlighting the last few years with the hype of the Cold War deception allowing for the rise of the dark military industrial complex which seems to have a penchant for human sacrifice.  Note that I have argued many times that Mk Ultra was not merely a mind control experiment, but was about the entire biosphere, under the Department of Energy.Cop Hop discovers the advanced weapons lab facility is involved in MK Ultra   something I have discussed many times. . The sacrifice of the youth for the dark designs of the shadow government is the ultimate conspiracy in the series, but what is more remarkable than this is the explanation by the Man in Black Dr. Brenner (Matthew Modine) that the sacrifice of sons and daughters for the gorgodemon is for the good of America.  In other words, we are given the impression our villain knows the real source of the dark power in Hawkins, the demonic, and that the sacrifice of humans and blood draws it nearer and nearer.  Foolishly assuming this dark energy can be harnessed for U.S. supremacy, Dr. Brenner is behind both MK Ultra and the SDI program that requires the sacrifice of America s  sons and daughters !  This spiritual dimension is the accurate and insightful aspect of the series, but the message is not all good.Dr. Brenner demands more demonic channeling from El. Note her similarity of appearance to the Princess in The Never Ending Story..  The flip side, as mentioned, is that El as an androgynous, yet dominantly feminine archetype, is a form of the incarnation of the goddess.  We have seen this of late in pop fiction more times than I can count, in examples like Hanna, Hunger Games, Lucy, Ex Machina and Jupiter Ascending, where the gnostic perspective of exalting the opposing force to the male is assumed to bring a cosmically needed  balance to the war hawk patriarchy.  A perennial myth of liberal fantasies, the feminist archetype will in no way bring peace and balance, only more destruction as gender roles continue to be confused.  Feminism is part of that very destruction, and the fact that El shouts out in the aether  God,   Dad  and  Gone,  suggests her association with Dr. Brenner as her  dad  and Father God s lack of answer to her call, means the solution to the spiritual problems of man can be found in a Luciferian evolution of humans beyond the  traps  of gender and evil patriarchal deities.  In occultist Edmund Spenser s Faerie Queen, we read:Downe in the bottome of the deepe Abysse Where Demogorgon in dull darknesse pent, Farre from the view of Gods and heauens blis, The hideous Chaos keepes, their dreadfull dwelling is.   (Book IV, Canto ii, stanza 47)In the process of becoming cruciform, the sacred feminine pistis Sophia incarnate destroys the patriarchal  non-God. .  Indeed, El annihilates the cruciform Demogorgon as if it were a demiurge that has imprisoned the town spiritually.  This is precisely the Luciferian view   Jesus and/or God the Father are demiurges who have imprisoned humans in this dimension and sap their energy as vampires, requiring blood sacrifice.  Of course, none of that is true, as the Logos is the salvation of the human race, reconciling them to God by becoming Incarnate and destroying Death.  In the gnostic scheme the roles are reversed, where El becomes the Luciferian dark hero rescuing the town through her sacrifice to destroy the cruciform demon-god.  And, as you probably guessed, that is why her name is  El,  recalling the old Canaanite term for the gods who warred against Jehovah in the Bible.  In fact, the Demogorgon is generally traced back to the demiurge.The series also uses numerology frequently, such as  11  and  77  suggesting the demonology of Crowley and references to 9/11 as a ritual initiation.  Interestingly, light is mentioned several times in the series as both a means of communication and symbol of enlightenment.  As you can see in the above image,  photosynthesis  is placed behind El as she dissolves the Demogorgon, suggesting the dissolution of Traditional Religion by  enlightenment,  perfectly consonant with the message of Gnosticism and Luciferianism.The gateways have been opened through mass human sacrifice of America s sons and daughters   the  new man  is a dark, half-androgynous goddess who will destroy the  genocidal  patriarchal religions and bring a new Amerikan aeon of the crowned and conquering girl-child, a Luciferian world order.READ MORE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hollywood FilesTo hear Jay s full podcasts, see more information and learn how you can become a subscriber to JaysAnalysis.Jay Dyer is the author of the forthcoming title, Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day.

6212,Trump’s New ‘Christian Policy’ Advisor ACTUALLY Thinks He Can Control The Weather (VIDEO),"Move over, Storm-From-X-Men! In addition to having gigantic hands (the most giganticestest in the world, no less!), a huge dong (you can see it from space), and a daughter he totally doesn t want to sleep with (or does he?), Donald Trump has managed to pick up a new ally: an old white dude who can control the weather!In his effort to pander to evangelicals, Trump has enlisted the aid of Frank Amedia, a televangelist who blames AIDS on  unnatural sex  who entered into a conspiracy to fix a court case for a friend in 2001. He s also able to control the weather through the power of Jesus, or something.Amedia, who now serves as the billionaire s liaison for Christian policy,  claims that he personally saved his daughter from disaster when an earthquake off the coast of Japan sent a tsunami to a Hawaiian island on which his precious little snowflake was staying. Thanks to the power of prayer and an ego large enough to think that an omnipotent being would even notice him, let alone do him a solid, Trump s  God guy  says he was able to talk his BFF into stopping the tsunami just off the shore of the island. I stood at the edge of my bed and I said,  In the name of Jesus, I declare that tsunami to stop now,  he says in a video in which he tells the tale of that time he and God went all  X-Men  on that storm.  And I specifically said,  I declare those waters to recede,  and I said,  Father, that is my child, I am your child, I m coming to you now and asking you to preserve her.  Apostle, it was seen by 400 people on a cliff. It was on YouTube, it was actually on the news that that tsunami stopped 200 feet off of shore. Even after having sucked the waters in, it churned and it went on and did devastation in the next island. Interestingly, he seems entirely unconcerned with the people who live on the next island over. Maybe there are limits to God s power and these  Christians  know better than to ask him to do more than save their own skins.Last December, a Texas woman also exhibited this strange weather control power. Sabrina Lowe of Rowlett says she saved her family s lives when she asked God to redirect a tornado to a neighboring town. Apparently, God listened. Lowe s family was spared, but the tornado went on to kill an additional eight people. While little is known about these rare superhuman powers, it seems that weather control thus far has a rather limited scope. Further study is needed.Watch Amedia talk about his weather control capabilities below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"May 23, 2016",0
1666,Trump Set Up An Alien Crime Hotline And It Went Exactly Like You’re Thinking Right Now (TWEETS),"Recently, Donald Trump became the second major elected leader in history to publish a newsletter focusing on crimes committed by a segment of the population he wanted to demonize   Adolf Hitler with  The Criminal Jew  (a regularly published list of crimes allegedly committed by Jews) and Donald Trump with his Weekly and Declined Detainer Outcome Report, a regular publication of crimes allegedly committed by immigrants. The word  allegedly is important here, because Trump s list so far has been mostly Latinos who are accused but have not been convicted of anything at all.Trump decided that a newsletter attacking all immigrants because some allegedly have committed crimes (at a much lower rate than the rest of us), so he established VOICE   an entire department committed to criminalizing the Jews immigrants.

953,U.S. business group worries Trump unprepared for commercial talks with China,"A top U.S. business lobby in China said on Tuesday it was concerned U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration was not making sufficient preparation for talks on imbalances in the bilateral economic relationship ahead of his November visit. Little advance work has been done for the visit, said William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. He was referring to meetings by working level officials to negotiate outcomes on commercial issues for Trump’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. “From what I understand, there really hasn’t been much of that for this visit, which makes us a bit concerned that there may not be much discussion on the structural issues,” Zarit told reporters in Beijing. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will bring a business delegation to Beijing during Trump’s visit. Some in the U.S. business community are worried that deals announced on the trip could distract from solutions to long-standing complaints over discriminatory Chinese policies and market access restrictions. Zarit said he hoped proposed deals from the business delegation “do not overshadow the real need for structural changes in the economic relationship”. Trump, who will stop in five Asian countries on his first visit to the region as president, will arrive in Beijing on Nov. 8. U.S. officials were “still waiting” for a Chinese response to issues raised during the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue in July, Zarit said, though he did not give specifics. He called Chinese officials “master negotiators” and said the U.S. government and business community had long suffered from a less strategic view of the economic relationship. “And I think there is no exception with this administration,” Zarit said.  He added that it was “not unreasonable” to expect more progress 10 months into Trump’s presidency. Ross, has said the United States will be looking for “immediate results” and “tangible agreements” during Trump’s visit, but has acknowledged that market access, intellectual property rights, and tariffs are more complex and will take a longer time to negotiate. Washington and Beijing launched a 100-day economic plan during Trump’s first meeting with Xi in April, including some industry-specific announcements, such as the resumption of American beef sales in China. But U.S. business groups have expressed disappointment over the extent of the outcomes. Xi vowed on Monday that China would take more measures to open up the economy. He made the remarks at a meeting with members of an advisory board to Tsinghua University’s School of Economics and Management, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O) chief executive Tim Cook and Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) Mark Zuckerberg.  China will make joint efforts with the United States to “take each other’s interests and concerns into consideration, resolve disputes and contradictions, and engage in win-win cooperation”, Xi said according to the official China Daily newspaper. But such frequently made pledges have done little to assuage foreign companies’ concerns over ownership caps in key sectors, such as autos, securities, insurance, and information technology. U.S. business lobbies argue that their members are restricted in those industries while Chinese companies operate freely in the U.S. market. They have also criticized Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” plan, which offers government backing for sectors the Chinese government deems strategic. Particularly galling to foreign tech firms are a slate of new national security and cyber security regulations that mandate companies store crucial data within China and pass security reviews they argue could put business secrets at risk. “Basically, when we look at that, what it boils down to for us is it’s a company competing against a country,” Zarit said.",politicsNews,"October 31, 2017 ",0
17818,"ACTRESS ACCUSES Weinstein Buddy, Actor GEORGE CLOONEY Of Helping To “Blacklist” Her After She Reported Sexual Harassment","The Hill   During a recent interview, Clooney describes conservative criticism of Democrats associated with film producer Harvey Weinstein as  a little pot and kettle,  noting the prior sexual harassment allegations levied against conservative figures like Roger Ailes and Bill O Reilly. Yeah, that s a little pot and kettle there, unfortunately. But I think that everything gets politicized these days. The reality is that this is a problem deeply ingrained in our society,  Clooney told The Daily Beast when asked about criticisms coming from conservatives in the days since a New York Times report that detailed accusations of sexual harassment against Weinstein.

20677,Trump: 'Sad day' for North Korea if U.S. takes military action,"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would prefer not to use military action against North Korea to counter its nuclear and missile threat but that if he did it would be a  very sad day  for the leadership in Pyongyang. Trump again pointedly declined to rule out a U.S. military response following North Korea s sixth and most powerful nuclear test as his administration seeks increased economic sanctions, saying Pyongyang was  behaving badly and it s got to stop.   Military action would certainly be an option. Is it inevitable? Nothing is inevitable,  Trump said during a news conference. I would prefer not going the route of the military,  Trump said.  If we do use it on North Korea, it will be a very sad day for North Korea.  Even as Trump has insisted that now is not the time to talk to North Korea, senior members of his administration have made clear that the door to a diplomatic solution remains open, especially given the U.S. assessment that any pre-emptive strike would unleash massive North Korean retaliation. While Trump talked tough on North Korea, China agreed on Thursday that the United Nations should take more action against Pyongyang but also kept pushing for dialogue to help resolve the standoff. North Korea, which is pursuing its nuclear and missile program in defiance of international condemnation, said it would respond to any new U.N. sanctions and U.S. pressure with  powerful counter measures , accusing the United States of aiming for war. The United States wants the U.N. Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban its exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad, and to subject leader Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday. Pressure from Washington has ratcheted up since North Korea conducted its nuclear test on Sunday. That test, along with a series of missile launches, showed it was close to achieving its goal of developing a powerful nuclear weapon that could reach the United States.  Given the new developments on the Korean peninsula, China agrees that the U.N. Security Council should make a further response and take necessary measures,  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters.  Any new actions taken by the international community against the DPRK should serve the purpose of curbing the DPRK s nuclear and missile programs, while at the same time be conducive to restarting dialogue and consultation,  he said, referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea. China is by far North Korea s biggest trading partner, accounting for 92 percent of two-way trade last year. It also provides hundreds of thousands of tonnes of oil and fuel to the impoverished regime. Trump has urged China to do more to rein in its neighbor, which was typically defiant on Thursday.  We will respond to the barbaric plotting around sanctions and pressure by the United States with powerful counter measures of our own,  North Korea said in a statement by its delegation to an economic forum in Vladivostok, in Russia s Far East. A U.N. Security Council diplomat said the U.S. draft was  the  cutting room floor  resolution, it s everything  and that Russia had questioned what leverage it would leave the Security Council if North Korea continued to conduct nuclear and ballistic missile testing.    Russia and China are not on board with the content of the resolution,  the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The United States has said it wants the draft resolution to be voted on Monday. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in spoke in Vladivostok and agreed to try to persuade China and Russia to cut off oil to North Korea as much as possible, according to South Korean officials. North Korea accused South Korea and Japan of  dirty politics.  North Korea says it needs its weapons to protect itself from U.S. aggression. South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. While successive U.S. administrations have insisted they will never recognize North Korea as a nuclear-armed state,  Trump declined to answer a question on Thursday on whether he would accept a situation where Pyongyang would be deterred and contained from using its nuclear arsenal, saying he did not want to disclose his negotiating strategy. A senior U.S. official said afterwards it was unclear whether the Cold War-era deterrence model that Washington used with the Soviet Union could be applied to a rogue state like North Korea. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was grave risk that North Korea could  miscalculate  the U.S. response to its weapons testing and warned Pyongyang not to under-estimate Washington s resolve. South Korea installed the four remaining launchers of a U.S. anti-missile Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system on a former golf course south of its capital, Seoul, early on Thursday. Two launchers had already been deployed. More than 30 people were hurt when about 8,000 police broke up a blockade near the site by about 300 villagers and members of civic groups opposed to the deployment, fire officials said. The deployment has drawn strong objections from China, which believes the system s radar could be used to look deeply into its territory and will upset the regional security balance. Mexico on Thursday said it had declared the North Korean ambassador persona non grata in protest at the country s nuclear tests and gave him 72 hours to leave the country, an unusually firm step that moved it closely into line with Washington.  North Korea s nuclear activity is a serious risk for international peace and security and represents a growing threat to nations in the region, including fundamental allies of Mexico like Japan and South Korea,  the Mexican government said.  However, an official at the Mexican foreign ministry noted that President Enrique Pena Nieto s government was not breaking diplomatic ties with North Korea.",worldnews,"September 7, 2017 ",0
21255,Lebanon finds soldiers' bodies after retaking Islamic State-held area,"Lebanon has identified the bodies of six of its soldiers found along the Syrian border in an area held by Islamic State until three days ago, sources in the president s office said. The Lebanese army launched an offensive this month which ended with Islamic State militants leaving their last foothold along the border on Sunday. Since then the army has found 10 bodies in the area. DNA tests confirmed that six of those belonged to Lebanese soldiers, the sources and local media reported on Wednesday. Islamic State militants had for years held territory along the border, and captured 10 Lebanese soldiers in 2014 when they briefly overran the town of Arsal, one of the worst spillovers of the Syrian conflict into Lebanon. The militants and their families left the border area on Sunday under a ceasefire deal. The agreement included IS militants identifying where they had buried the soldiers  bodies, Lebanese army chief General Joseph Aoun said on Wednesday.  I had two choices: either I continue the battle and not know the soldiers  fate, or I submit to the situation and find out. Their souls are my responsibility,  he told reporters. It was not immediately clear if all six belonged to those captured in 2014, however - one of the bodies discovered is believed to belong to a soldier killed in the recent fighting. Of the 10 captured in 2014, one was killed shortly after and footage of his execution was published by the militants. Another is believed to have joined Islamic State.

858,U.S. draft U.N. resolution seeks extension of Syria chemical probe,"The United States has circulated a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would extend by two years the mandate of an international inquiry into chemical weapons attacks in Syria, after Russia vetoed an extension last week. The U.S. draft, which was seen by Reuters on Thursday, says Syria must not develop or produce chemical weapons, and it calls on all parties in Syria to provide full cooperation with the international probe. The investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) - was unanimously created by the 15-member Security Council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November. The JIM found that the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad was to blame for a chemical attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people in April, according to a report sent to the Security Council on Oct. 26. Two days earlier, Russia vetoed a renewal of the JIM mandate after it was unsuccessful in getting the Security Council to postpone the vote. U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Russia wanted to discuss the Khan Sheikhoun report before the vote. Russia, whose air force and special forces have been supporting the Syrian army, says there is no evidence to show Damascus was responsible for the attack. It maintains that the chemicals that killed civilians belonged to rebels, not Assad’s government. [nL8N1N86I0] On Wednesday, the United States admonished Russia for its veto. [nL2N1N805Y] “Russia’s attempts to undermine and eliminate the JIM show a callous disregard for the suffering and loss of life caused by the use of chemical weapons and an utter lack of respect for international norms,” the White House said in a statement.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by phone on Thursday it was unacceptable to politicize the work of chemical weapons inspectors in Syria, Russia’s foreign ministry said. [nL8N1MP0GI] A Russian draft resolution calls for a six-month extension of the inquiry, with the possibility of further extensions, and asks for investigators to collect environmental samples in connection with the Khan Sheikhoun probe, among other things. In their 14th report since 2011, U.N. investigators said in September they had documented 33 chemical weapons attacks to date. [nL8N1LN29P] Twenty-seven were by the Assad government, including seven between March 1 and July 7. Perpetrators had not been identified yet in six attacks, they said. The Assad government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. It said its strikes in Khan Sheikhoun hit a weapons depot belonging to rebel forces, an assertion “excluded” by U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria Chairman Paulo Pinheiro. That attack led U.S. President Donald Trump to launch the first U.S. air strikes on a Syrian air base.",politicsNews,"November 3, 2017 ",0

9084,JUST IN: CROOKED DOJ OFFICIAL Didn’t Reveal That His Wife Was Being Paid By Fusion GPS to Get Dirt on Trump [Video],"We ve been covering the curious case of DOJ official Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie Ohr What they did is so corrupt and underhanded! Nellie worked for the opposition research firm hired by the Democrats to get dirt on Trump (see below). Her husband would take whatever Nellie produced about Trump and hand it over to the FBI! Unreal! This should be jail time because of the omission of the conflict of interest being an ethics violation. So far, it appears as though Bruce Ohr has just been demoted.NOW WE FIND OUT THAT BRUCE OHR HID THE FUSION GPS PAYMENTS TO HIS WIFE:Daily Caller reports:Bruce Ohr, the Department of Justice official who brought opposition research on President Donald Trump to the FBI, did not disclose that Fusion GPS, which performed that research at the Democratic National Committee s behest, was paying his wife, and did not obtain a conflict of interest waiver from his superiors at the Justice Department, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.The omission may explain why Ohr was demoted from his post as associate deputy attorney general after the relationship between Fusion GPS and his wife emerged and Fusion founder Glenn Simpson acknowledged meeting with Ohr. Willfully falsifying government ethics forms can carry a penalty of jail time, if convicted.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the  dossier.  Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.The DOJ used it to obtain a warrant to wiretap a Trump adviser, but didn t disclose to the judge that the DNC and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s campaign had funded the research and that Ohr had a financial relationship with the firm that performed it   which could be, it turns out, because Ohr doesn t appear to have told his supervisors. Some have suggested that the financial payments motivated Bruce Ohr to actively push the case.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON NELLIE OHR:This is a big deal even though we re sure the main stream media will ignore it.

1539,Ranking Dem On House Russia Probe Has EXPLOSIVE News For Trump That Will Have Him Running Scared,"As everybody who still believes in democracy and true freedom reels from FBI Director James Comey s firing, the media and members of Congress have been frantically working to get the deets on what happened. Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee (which is conducting its own investigation into Russia), just dropped a truth bomb about Comey, and Trump would be wise to go find a cave and hide in it now.Schiff was asked, on CNN, whether he believes this is a cover-up. He doesn t. He thinks it s something worse: It s a brazen interference with a criminal investigation. After all, the president calls this whole investigation a fake, and here you had an FBI director who was seriously looking into whether Trump associates were colluding with the Russians. The end of his statement to CNN should be particularly jarring to anybody familiar with history. Watch below:Rep. Adam Schiff on firing of FBI Director James Comey:  It s a brazen interference with a criminal investigation  https://t.co/5SXgAuTVBP  CNN (@CNN) May 10, 2017Earlier this year, the White House tried to get the FBI to publicly dispute stories appearing in The New York Times about contacts between Trump s associates and Russian actors. They ve been trying to bend the FBI to their will for a long time, and when Comey wouldn t lie under oath for them, or end his Russia probe, Trump decided to fire him.In fact, Jeff Sessions was actually told to find reasons to fire Comey, and they ve been working on it for at least a week. Trump likely wants someone in that position who ll end that investigation before they discover something really damning. He wants a puppet.If Trump was innocent, the White House wouldn t have been looking for reasons to fire Comey now. Comey may not have even been fired, but if he was, Trump probably would have done it when he took office under the guise of getting a fresh start, as Schiff said to CNN. This is not the behavior of an innocent man.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 9, 2017",0
18192,STUNNING DISREGARD FOR LAW: 11 CA Counties Have More Registered Voters Than Voting Age Citizens…Look Who They Voted For In Last Election,"But..b but it isn t fair to ask for voter ID says the party that dominates the states that refuse to cooperate with Trump s election commission. The more corruption that s exposed through post-election voting investigations, the more we begin to understand why so many Democrat pundits and liberal media outlets were so sure Hillary had the election in the bag..Eleven counties in California have more registered voters than voting age adults in the county.Judicial Watch announced it sent a notice-of-violation letter to the state of California and 11 of its counties threatening to sue in federal court if it does not clean its voter registration lists as mandated by the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA). Both the NVRA and the federal Help America Vote Act require states to take reasonable steps to maintain accurate voting rolls. The August 1 letter was sent on behalf of several Judicial Watch California supporters and the Election Integrity Project California, Inc.In the letter, Judicial Watch noted that public records obtained on the Election Assistance Commission s 2016 Election Administration Voting Survey and through verbal accounts from various county agencies show 11 California counties have more registered voters than voting-age citizens: Imperial (102%), Lassen (102%), Los Angeles (112%), Monterey (104%), San Diego (138%), San Francisco (114%), San Mateo (111%), Santa Cruz (109%), Solano (111%), Stanislaus (102%), and Yolo (110%).In the letter, Judicial Watch noted that Los Angeles County officials  informed us that the total number of registered voters now stands at a number that is a whopping 144% of the total number of resident citizens of voting age. Remember when the Huffington Post denied voter fraud was an actual thing in America, while calling Hillary Clinton, (the candidate who clearly benefitted from illegal voting practices) the  legitimate President-Elect? Under Section 8 of the NVRA, states are required to make a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from official lists due to  the death of the registrant  or  a change in the residence of the registrant,  and requires states to ensure noncitizens are not registered to vote.There is  strong circumstantial evidence that California municipalities are not conducting reasonable voter registration list maintenance as mandated under the NVRA,  Judicial Watch wrote in the notice letter sent to California Secretary of State Alex Padilla.

14497,"DESPERATE PROGRESSIVES ARE LOSING IN GERMANY: Leftist Politician Stabs Himself 17 Times, Blames German Right-Wing Extremists","The rampant migrant rape and violence is shining a light on the progressive agenda and it s exposing an ugly, reckless ideology that has dominated the EU for decades. The Left is in a battle to save itself and outside of stabbing themselves 17 times and then blaming the Right, there doesn t seem to be any way out of the mess they ve created. We recently posted about German citizens demanding  rapefugees  and economic migrants be gunned down at the border.For many the news fitted the current image of the #Kaltland [Cold Country]. A communication  that it would have been better not to have to make , published by the Schwerin local association of Die Linke [The Left, former East German Communist party] on late Tuesday evening on its Facebook page. According to this, Julian Kinzel, an 18-year-old member of the local Schwerin board was the victim of a knife attack in Wismar on Monday evening.  The three perpetrators beat him down and stabbed their victim around 17 times with a knife, according to a statement from the doctor who treated him , the statement reads. In the process Kinzel was said to have been insulted as a  gay communist pig .  This and the clothing worn by the perpetrators that is typical of the [far-right] scene (Thor Steinar) supports the suspicion that it was a crime with a far-right motivation,  said the local chairman Peter Brill.The federal Left party even said the case was one of  attempted murder .  We are shocked,  party explained on Wednesday on Twitter. Federal managing director Matthias H hn:  The current case proves in a tragic way once again how dangerous and inhuman right-wing extremism is.  Dietmar Bartsch, head of the Left grouping in the federal parliament, condemned the crime  in the strongest possible way  and explained that the Left would not give up in its fight against right-wing extremism. Party leader Katja Kipping said:  The knife attack is horrific and also an attack on democracy.  Already on Wednesday the speaker of the Rostock police management board, Isabel Wenzel, described the case as  somewhat nebulous. She made reference to the fact that Kinzel only filed a complaint later on Tuesday evening   and not personally at a police station, but via the internet. The hospital at which the young man was treated on Monday also did not report the case to police. Via: Der TagesspeigelJulian Kinzel warned in a reaction on the Facebook page of the Schwerin Left against further [right-wing] radicalisation:  Our answer to hate must be love, to stupidity, reason and to violence, solidarity. Now the police hace arranged for the student to be subjected to forensic medical examination. The investigations up to now have come to the conclusion that Kinzel invented the attack. According to a statement from the Rostock police the  type of injuries do not correspond to the sequence of events that has been claimed in the attack.  On the contrary, it is  sufficiently probable  that Kinzel inflicted the injuries himself.",politics,"Feb 11, 2016",1
3393,Trump complicates travel ban case by grumbling at Justice Department,"President Donald Trump accused his own Justice Department on Monday of watering down his temporary travel ban on people from several predominantly Muslim countries, potentially hurting his case in the Supreme Court on the matter. In a series of early morning Twitter messages, Trump returned to the issue of the travel ban that he raised immediately after an attack in London on Saturday night that killed 7 people and wounded 48.  Legal experts said Trump’s tweets could complicate his legal team’s defense of the ban, since they contradict some of the arguments the government’s lawyers are making in court. Trump has presented the measure, which seeks to halt entry to the United States for 90 days for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and bar refugees for four months, as essential to prevent attacks in the United States.  Critics suing the government, including states and civil rights groups, say there is little national security justification for the move and the ban is discriminatory against Muslims. Federal courts have stopped it from being enforced. “The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original travel ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.,” Trump tweeted, referring to the country’s highest court.  “The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down travel ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!”  Federal courts struck down Trump’s first temporary travel ban, an executive order he issued a week after taking office on Jan 20. To overcome the legal hurdles, he replaced it with a new order in March. The second ban was also put on hold by courts. The Justice Department says the courts should look only at the text of the order, not at the president’s comments during the 2016 election campaign about imposing a ban on Muslims. “His tweets invite the question: if the second ban is ‘politically correct,’ what is un-P.C. about the original? And the answer is obvious: Trump told us it’s about banning Muslims,” said Micah Schwartzman, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.  Trump, whose populist brand of politics includes criticizing political correctness as an evasion of uncomfortable truths, called in a statement on his campaign website for a “complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” “The President’s tweets may help encourage his base, but they can’t help him in court,” said Jonathan Adler, a professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law.  Trump’s legal team asked the Supreme Court last week to reverse rulings by lower courts and allow the revised travel ban to go into effect immediately. At issue before the court is whether the travel curbs violate the U.S. Constitution’s ban on favoring one religion over another.  The revised order removed language barring legal permanent residents and a clause that protected religious minorities. It also removed Iraq from the list of targeted countries. Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network shortly after signing the first ban that it would help Syrian Christians fleeing the country’s civil war, a comment lawyers challenging the ban have pointed to as a sign it meant to favor Christians over Muslims. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump agreed to modify the language of the first order in an effort to satisfy the concerns of a federal appeals court that halted it, but he preferred the stronger action. “He wants to go as far and as strong as possible under the Constitution to protect the people in this country,” Sanders told a news briefing on Monday. Neal Katyal, an attorney for the state of Hawaii, which  challenged the revised ban, said the president’s comments only bolstered its case. “It’s kinda odd to have the defendant in Hawaii v Trump acting as our co-counsel. We don’t need the help but will take it!” Katyal said in a tweeted response to Trump’s posts on Monday.           Trump also tweeted on Monday that his administration was implementing tougher vetting of would-be visitors to the United States, adding: “The courts are slow and political!” Legal experts said that comment could also undermine the government’s case that the travel ban is urgently needed, given the government has said the temporary travel restrictions would free up resources to put in place tougher screening protocols. Last week, the administration rolled out new policies on visa applications for some people who are deemed subject to greater scrutiny.    U.S. Senator Ben Cardin, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and opposes the ban, said on CNN the tweets showed the Republican president’s disdain for the judicial branch. Trump needs five votes from the nine-judge Supreme Court in his favor to put the ban into effect. With the confirmation of Trump’s Supreme Court pick earlier this year, the court retains a 5-4 conservative majority, while the lower courts that have ruled thus far have been more liberal-leaning.  Peter Margulies, an immigration expert at Roger Williams University School of Law in Rhode Island, said of Trump’s tweets, “To the extent that Trump is sort of a bull in a china shop, that might make the Supreme Court nervous.”  On Friday, the Supreme Court asked the challengers of the travel ban to file responses to the emergency request by June 12. Trump’s administration would then likely to file its own response before the court’s nine justices make their decision. White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway defended Trump’s tweets following the London attack. In an NBC interview on Monday, she cited a media “obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little of what he does as president.”",politicsNews,"June 5, 2017 ",0
20573,U.S. calls for U.N. Security Council vote on North Korea on Monday,"The United States on Friday told the U.N. Security Council that it intends to call a meeting on Monday to vote on a draft resolution establishing additional sanctions on North Korea for its missile and nuclear program, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said in a statement. The United States wants the Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban its exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad, and to subject leader Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear how North Korean ally China and Russia would vote, but a senior U.S. official on Friday night expressed skepticism that either nation would accept anything more stringent than a ban on imports of North Korean textiles. Chinese officials have privately expressed fears that imposing an oil embargo could risk triggering massive instability in its neighbor. A Security Council resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by permanent members Britain, the United States, France, Russia or China to pass. Tension on the Korean peninsula has escalated as the North has stepped up the development of weapons, testing a string of missiles this year, including one flying over Japan, and conducting its sixth nuclear test on Sunday. South Korea braced for a possible further missile test by North Korea when it marks its founding anniversary on Saturday. Experts believe the isolated regime is close to its goal of developing a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States, something President Donald Trump has vowed to prevent.",worldnews,"September 9, 2017 ",0

17903,Turkish PM says Idlib operation aims to prevent migrant wave from Syria,"Turkey s military operations in Syria s rebel-held province of Idlib aim to prevent a wave of migration into Turkey, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Tuesday. Turkey has said it will provide assistance to rebels it has long backed as it implements a de-escalation agreement designed to reduce fighting with pro-government forces in the area, the most populous pocket of Syria still in rebel hands. On Sunday, a Turkish army reconnaissance team scouted the Idlib province before an expected military operation to impose peace in the bitterly contested Syrian northwest.  The reason for our activities is to prepare the groundwork and prevent a potential migrant wave into our country and lower tensions,  Yildirim told a parliamentary meeting of the ruling AK Party. Turkey, which is already hosting around three million Syrians, has been one of the biggest supporters of rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the six-and-a-half-year war, but its focus has moved from ousting him to securing its own border against jihadist and Kurdish groups. Yildirim also said Turkey aimed to create control points in Idlib for future deployments, and that the activities of the armed forces in Idlib would help prevent internal conflicts between civilians and militant groups in the region.",worldnews,"October 10, 2017 ",0

A column carried on Tuesday by DPRK Today, one of the reclusive and dynastic state’s mouthpieces, described Trump as a “wise politician” and the right choice for U.S. voters in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.

Trump instead has told Reuters he was prepared to talk to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to stop Pyongyang’s nuclear program, and that China should also help solve the problem.  North Korea, known officially as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), is under U.N. sanctions over its past nuclear tests. South Korea and the United States say its calls for dialogue are meaningless until it takes steps to end its nuclear ambitions.  DPRK Today also said Trump’s suggestion that the United States should pull its troops from South Korea until Seoul pays more was the way to achieve Korean unification.  “It turns out that Trump is not the rough-talking, screwy, ignorant candidate they say he is, but is actually a wise politician and a prescient presidential candidate,” said the column, written by a China-based Korean scholar identified as Han Yong Muk.  DPRK Today is among a handful of news sites run by the isolated North, although its content is not always handled by the main state-run media.  It said promising to resolve issues on the Korean peninsula through “negotiations and not war” was the best option for America, which it said is “living every minute and second on pins and needles in fear of a nuclear strike” by North Korea.  The North has for years called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the South as the first step toward peace on the Korean peninsula and demanded Washington sign a peace treaty to replace the truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.

4133,Uphill battle looms as Trump seeks revamped healthcare plan,"President Donald Trump, striving to make good on a top campaign promise, is pushing his fellow Republicans who control Congress to pass revamped healthcare legislation but the same intraparty squabbling that torpedoed it last month could do it again. Trump is looking for his first major legislative victory since taking office in January. House of Representatives Republicans are exploring compromises aimed at satisfying the party’s most conservative members without antagonizing its moderates, but it remained unclear on Friday whether a viable bill would emerge. Trump on Friday played down the need for Congress to act on the legislation before he reaches his 100th day in office next weekend, telling reporters, “We’ll see what happens - no particular rush.” Trump on Thursday had predicted “a good chance of getting it soon,” either “next week or shortly thereafter.” On Friday, he said it “doesn’t matter if it’s next week.” Congress, returning from a recess next week, also will be working against the clock to pass legislation to keep the government funded past April 28 and avert a federal shutdown. Healthcare legislation did not appear on the schedule released on Friday by House Republican leaders of bills to be considered next week. “We’re going to get it done when it’s appropriate in terms of getting to that 216,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters, referring to the vote total needed for House passage before the bill goes to the Senate. Trump’s party cannot afford defections because Democrats remain unified against the Republican quest to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement, dubbed Obamacare. Trump campaigned on a pledge to discard Obamacare. In a stinging setback for Trump, Speaker Paul Ryan pulled the legislation from the House floor on March 24 before allowing it to come to a vote amid a revolt by conservatives in a faction called the House Freedom Caucus and moderates unhappy with concessions to the conservatives. Republicans have called Obamacare a government overreach. The law enabled 20 million Americans to obtain insurance, many through an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor. A senior House Republican aide said it was not clear whether a revamped Republican plan can attract 216 votes, adding that without a legislative text it was impossible to do a vote count to assess its chances. Moderate Republican Representative Tom MacArthur is pushing a proposal to allow states to waive some Obamacare provisions. MacArthur’s office said he has discussed it with other Republican lawmakers, the House leadership and the White House. No text has emerged, but an outline of his proposal said states could seek to relax “essential benefits” that Obamacare requires insurance plans to cover, such as emergency room trips, maternity and newborn care, and mental health services. States also could request waivers to Obamacare’s ban on insurers charging sick customers higher premiums than healthy customers. But states would have to establish “high-risk pools” using government funds to help pay for insurance for people with costly medical conditions. Representative Rodney Davis told CNN on Friday he did not know what was in the deal, but added, “I’m not going to be for a plan that is going to allow for pre-existing conditions to not be covered.” MacArthur and Davis are members of the centrist House Republican Tuesday Group. Freedom Caucus member Representative Dave Brat told CNN the new proposal gives states more say healthcare but was the “same fundamental bill” that collapsed last month. The Republican plan, as written last month, would end the Medicaid expansion, let states impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients, rescind a range of Obamacare taxes, get rid of a penalty on people who refuse to obtain insurance, and ditch Obamacare’s income-based subsidies to help people buy insurance while creating less-generous age-based tax credits. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast the earlier version of the plan would increase by 24 million the number of Americans without medical insurance by 2026. During a Thursday conference call with House Democrats, their leader, Nancy Pelosi, urged them to remain united against the Republican legislation, saying it would increase healthcare costs and provide less insurance coverage, an aide who was on the telephone call said.",politicsNews,"April 21, 2017 ",1

13039,"Bomb blast kills nine people in Pakistan, near Afghan border","A bomb rigged to a motorcycle exploded in a militant-plagued part of northwest Pakistan near the Afghan border, killing nine people, officials said on Wednesday, the latest violence in a recent rise in attacks in the nuclear-armed country. The bomb was detonated by remote control late on Tuesday when an army vehicle passed in Mir Ali town in the North Waziristan region, said three Pakistani officials who declined to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media. A spokesman for the Pakistani army, which is responsible for security in the volatile, ethnic Pashtun region, did not respond to calls seeking comment.  Waziristan is bleeding once again,  said police official  Tahir Khan in Peshawar, the main city in the northwest, who said he had heard about the blast but had no details. No militant group claimed responsibility. North Waziristan was long home to Pakistani and foreign Islamist militants linked to the Taliban and al Qaeda until the Pakistani army launched a major push against them in mid-2014.  The military offensive cleared the militants from their bases and largely broke up their networks, forcing them to flee either over the porous border into Afghanistan or to other parts of Pakistan.  But the militants have struck back, sometimes with major attacks. Last Friday, three Pakistani Taliban suicide bombers stormed a college in Peshawar, killing eight students and a guard. A week earlier, a senior police commander was killed in a suicide bomb attack in Peshawar. On Tuesday, the Pakistani Taliban killed a member of an anti-Taliban faction in another part of the northwest, while a bomb aimed at members of another pro-government faction killed five people a week earlier. The Pakistani Taliban are fighting to topple the government and impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law. They are loosely allied with the Afghan Taliban who ruled most of Afghanistan until they were overthrown by U.S.-backed military action in 2001. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Pakistan this week to urge it to  redouble  efforts to rein in militants accused of using the country as a base to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.",worldnews,"December 6, 2017 ",0

Belt-tightening at MONUSCO, which has about 18,000 uniformed personnel, is part of a broader push by the United States, the biggest U.N. contributor, to cut costs. In June, the 193 U.N. member states agreed to a total $600 million in cuts to more than a dozen missions for the year ending June 30, 2018.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said at the time:  We re only getting started.  On Wednesday the 15-member U.N. Security Council will discuss peacekeeping reform during the annual gathering of world leaders.  Diplomats said the council was due to adopt a resolution pushing for improved accountability, transparency and effectiveness and to make peacekeepers more flexible. Critics worry that harsh cuts could harm operations in volatile African states.  My intention is to do everything to preserve the integrity of the peacekeeping missions, but, of course, to do also everything possible to make it in the most effective and cost-effective way,  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters last week.  The United Nations, which has spent $18 billion on peacekeeping in Congo since the mission began in 1999, says reforms are bearing fruit. But analysts and some U.N. insiders say progress is hampered by administrators in New York dodging thorny issues like confusion over the mission s priorities and a culture that appears to protect senior, well-paid officials at all costs. In July, for example, Safia Boly became deputy head of the MONUSCO division administering the mission s downsizing, despite the fact that a year earlier, a U.N. tribunal ruled she had abused her authority and disregarded rules at an office in Uganda where she served as operations manager.  Put very simply, and in other words, who was protecting Ms. Boly and why?  the tribunal wrote in its judgment. Boly did not respond to an emailed request for comment. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said the affair was closed and that it was not appropriate to comment on a confidential internal process.  This sends a signal that U.N. headquarters is not really interested in reform and cleaning up the system,  said a Western diplomat about Boly s case. In another case, members of an engineering unit in Goma allegedly demanded hundreds of dollars from locals in return for help to be recruited for temporary work, according to a U.N. document seen by Reuters. U.S. President Donald Trump wants to cap the U.S. share of the $7.3 billion peacekeeping bill at 25 percent, down from 28.5 percent, a level he says is  unfair . At a meeting on U.N. reform on Monday, Trump said the world body was hamstrung by  bureaucracy and mismanagement .  A peacekeeping mission in Ivory Coast has closed and troop levels in Sudan s Darfur region are due to be halved, but U.N. officials say they need more, not fewer, blue helmets in hot spots like Mali, Central African Republic and South Sudan.  Peacekeeping reform is essential, and the U.S. should lead in demanding better performance and accountability. But that will not be achieved by crippling the ability of U.N. troops and civilian personnel to operate where they re needed most,  said Matt Wells, senior crisis adviser at Amnesty International. MONUSCO s military leaders want to replace underperforming units, long accused of passivity in protecting civilians, with more capable troops. But they are held back by long-standing reluctance among member states to risk soldiers  lives in distant conflicts. In a July 15 cable addressed to New York, Sidikou outlined his streamlining plans. They included reducing the force size by at least 750 troops, cutting official travel and reducing rations provided to Congolese soldiers.  In another cable three days later, Sidikou said he intended to ease restrictions on where units can operate, making them more flexible and able to respond to crises. Election delays and President Joseph Kabila s refusal to step down have fueled violence across Congo, where millions have died in conflicts over the past two decades. An agreement to hold an election by the end of this year is unlikely to hold.  After several years during which the focus had been largely on foreign armed groups, the U.N. mission is contending with increasingly dangerous local rebellions. One, in Kasai, on the border with Angola, has displaced 1.4 million people in a year.  In the near future, elections-related violence might erupt across the whole of the DRC. Consequently, the Force requires the freedom to deploy its troops in a timely manner, to wherever they may be required,  Sidikou s cable said.",worldnews,"September 19, 2017 ",1
